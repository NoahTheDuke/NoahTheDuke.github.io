    <p>I've been sitting on this release for a little while now, trying to find the right way to approach to supporting custom rules.</p><p>The way the rules work currently, when a file with <code>defrule</code> is evaluated, the <code>defrule</code> macro adds the generated rule to a global atom. This simplifies a lot of stuff in the codebase, and makes adding new rules to splint pretty easy: make a new file, require it in the entrypoint for the library. However, users can't access that entrypoint from the cli, and while I've not exactly hidden the code, I don't think people should have to write their own entrypoint wrappers merely to include their own rules.</p><p>Inspired by RuboCop YET AGAIN, I've added a new option, settable in the config file or by passing the relevant flag at the cli, to call <code>load-file</code> on a given set of files which will presumably call their custom <code>defrule</code> invocations. Because I'm relying on Clojure's built-in behavior, there is no extra code necessary for me to parse or validate the paths myself; I pass them to <code>load-file</code> in a loop and print any exceptions that are thrown.</p>

    <p>i am the maintainer of the vim syntax highlighting file for just, <a href="https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/vim-just">vim-just</a>, and while i did the heavy lifting to write up the initial version back in 2021, i haven't cared much about keeping up with the latest changes and have let others make changes as they do.</p><p>last year, someone offered to help out so i added them to the repo. i suspect it's their first time being a "contributor" on an open source project cuz they've spent the last year absolutely dedicated to the task of improving both the syntax highlighting and the bespoke syntax test runner we have that's written in rust. the project isn't that exciting and doesn't require that much effort but they've stayed up to date (to the day) of new syntaxes added to just and have been poking and prodding the test runner to make it faster and more idiomatic, including writing their own custom version of vim's built-in <code>:ToHtml</code> as it was removed in neovim. today, they mentioned "but we don't want code like this in production" which cracked me up because there's no "production" to be had here! doesn't matter, they give a shit and so i give a shit with them.</p><p>there's no real point here, it's just fun to see someone really dive in and own something. i know open source maintenance is a touchy subject after the xz/liblzma stuff, but i still think it's worthwhile to give people a chance to make their mark and spend their effort on cool things.</p>

    <p>I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business. I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone - if possible - Jew, Gentile - black man - white. We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. We don’t want to hate and despise one another. In this world there is room for everyone. And the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.</p><p>Greed has poisoned men’s souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed. We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in. Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want. Our knowledge has made us cynical. Our cleverness, hard and unkind. We think too much and feel too little. More than machinery we need humanity. More than cleverness we need kindness and gentleness. Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost…</p><p>The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together. The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men - cries out for universal brotherhood - for the unity of us all. Even now my voice is reaching millions throughout the world - millions of despairing men, women, and little children - victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.</p>
