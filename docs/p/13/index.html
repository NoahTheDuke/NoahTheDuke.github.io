    <p>a friend asked me recently about my "poly" status with my wife, and i started to write a short thing which turned into a long thing. here it is as i sent it to her, to avoid editing and nitpicking it into not getting posted.</p><p>here's a bunch of pieces that all kind of commingle here, so it's a bit of a mess, but the short version is something like:</p><ol><li>i am poly and can and do experience familial and romantic love for multiple people at the same time.</li><li>i am a human bound by causality and time, so i can only do one thing at a time at any given time.</li><li>conceptually "love" is infinite and i can care about many people without effort, but relationships require time and energy for them to have any depth.</li><li>given that, if i'm going to have a meaningfully deep relationship, i need to put in greater and greater efforts to both achieve and then maintain it.</li><li>at a certain point, i can love multiple people, but i find myself disappointed when i want to have a shared history with someone (my now-wife May) but my history is split across N people. Shared history is an important aspect of relationships, and personally, i find great joy in being able to say "remember when we did X?"</li><li>likewise, when i was single and ready to mingle in 2017, i had basically infinite time to meet people and to spread myself out. that extra time has shrunk bit by bit since and now i have roughly 1.5 free hours before bed every day. if i want more than that in a given day, i am necessarily depriving both my wife and kids of valuable time with me and forcing my wife to do stuff like "make dinner, entertain the kids, put them to bed" alone.</li></ol>

    <p>i have a number of friends i used to see semi-regularly (at least once a year) that was helped by us both being active on facebook. now none of us are very active on facebook and i had some kids and everything is harder to schedule.</p><p>it's easy to say, "hey i know we haven't spoken in roughly 4 years but i miss you and hope you're doing okay" but how do i have it continue after we finish the pleasantries? the opening is easy, i just wrote it, but after, one on one conversation is hard to sustain without the ease of in-person dialogue.</p><p>i keep up with other friends because we're in group chats, so there's less pressure to speak directly to one person, you know? i can just throw into the chat "here's a dumb meme, here's a stray thought, here's a comment about my day". but when it's one on one, it feels like the silences are longer and it's harder to maintain any sort of connection.</p>

    <p>Before I got married, I heard lots of advice about how to handle money in marriage, such as ‚Äúhave separate bank accounts‚Äù and ‚Äúonly use one joint bank account‚Äù and ‚Äúas long as bills are covered, you should buy whatever you want‚Äù and ‚Äúevery penny must be accounted for to make sure nothing funny is happening‚Äù.</p><p>Back when we were Dual Income No Kids, I just sent her my half of the bills (as I had moved in with her and they were all in her name). It was easy and simple. Once we had our first kid and she quit her job, there was a question of how to handle spending money. I switched my direct deposit to give me an allowance (personal bills, etc) and then send the rest to her with the comment that she could spend as much as she wanted, that I both trusted her and thought she deserved to buy whatever she wanted.</p><p>This seemed fine but after two years, she admitted that she didn‚Äôt feel free to do whatever, that because her money was muddled in with the bills money, it felt bad to spend it on herself (even tho she knew I was okay with it).</p>

    <p>I‚Äôve started Death‚Äôs Door as a palate cleanser after finishing Ghost of Tsushima. I‚Äôm an hour in and most of the way through the first dungeon. This game rocks. Feels good to play, the art is pretty and reserved, the music is real nice, and I like this little universe they‚Äôve built. I‚Äôm surprisingly intrigued by the main conflict and I can‚Äôt wait to see where it goes.</p>

    <p>On the one hand, I don‚Äôt wanna hate on someone‚Äôs favorite thing.</p><p>On the other hand, I‚Äôm watching a truly boring-ass deathcore band rn and while I already don‚Äôt like deathcore, these folks are only making me hate them and the whole genre even more.</p><p>Giancarlo Esposito face: you think deathcore is not metal. I think classification arguments are dumb as shit and deathcore sucks regardless of what genre it is. We are not the same.</p>
