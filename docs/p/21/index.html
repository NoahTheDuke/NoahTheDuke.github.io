    <p>I feel like RRR showcased a style of melodrama that I don't see super frequently. The term that comes to mind is "legibility", a word/concept that @austin has placed into my brain. RRR doesn't try to use lots of dialogue or subtle acting, it leans into big emotions in all directions and keeps both the content and conveyance relatively easily understood, but then treats those big emotions as real and legitimate.</p><p>Mild spoilers below:</p><hr />

(<a href="https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/releases/tag/112">Release notes here.</a>)</p><p>My life has been a mess the last year and it pains me that I don't have the time or availability to put 20+ hours of work into jnet anymore, as it desperately needs it, so please accept my humble apologies for the long delay between releases. Congrats to the whole jnet team for their hard work and tireless efforts in implementing 120 new cards in the span of a couple weeks in preparation for this day.</p>

    <p>I have an alt that I use to write about my sex life and sexuality and related phenomena. I‚Äôd love to post it here, I suspect folks would be at least mildly interested, but I‚Äôve accidentally become a normie.</p><p>I have a wife who raises our kids while I work, and two kids who run my wife and me ragged. I have a nice suburban house and a steady paycheck and all of the modern accouterment. This is an extremely comfortable and peaceful life.</p><p>I lost my job at the start of 2022 and spent 1.5 months grinding to find a new job, terrified every day that I wouldn‚Äôt and we‚Äôd lose everything. That kind of situation, that kind of fear restricts what one considers reasonable risk, meaning that I won‚Äôt post about my sex life too publicly for fear of offending the wrong person in power who could ruin my shit.</p>

    <p>@staff feature request: if i see a self reply to a post, can the original be skipped? It‚Äôs one of my least favorite features from tumblr: seeing reply 3 with reply 2 with reply 1 to original post, then scroll down and see reply 2 with reply 1 to original post, then scroll down and see reply 1 to original post, then scroll down and see original post. Like holy shit, yes I get it, please leave me alone.</p>

    <p>I commented on someone else‚Äôs post about open source community norms and brought up Rich Hickey‚Äôs Open Source is Not About You. I said  that I admired the stance after initially thinking it rude. However,,,</p><p>I can‚Äôt help but wonder what Clojure could look like if it was less preciously held by those in charge. I don‚Äôt want Rust levels of development speed, that‚Äôs too much and too fast for my taste. But it dampens my enthusiasm for the language and my faith in the team when they respond with such disinterest in things that don‚Äôt materially impact them directly.</p><p>Sharp edges and places of friction are ignored or brushed away as unimportant, like stack traces or error messages in general. Bugs that have available patches can be left to bitrot, sometimes for years (concat stack overflow patch), and bugs without patches can be ignored or treated as too prevalent to fix (keyword regex, type hinting symbol vs vector in defn).</p>

    <p>So many dead and forgotten blogging platforms in my past. The only one I‚Äôve ever used with any consistency was LiveJournal; I think a lot of that came from it being the <em>only</em> blogging platform available.</p><p>I‚Äôve used Facebook as a blogging platform in the past, writing long form thoughts and ideas to my friends. That can feel better in the moment due to the laser precision audience but there‚Äôs a low ceiling of quality engagement and the closed platform means I can‚Äôt share beyond.</p><p>Why a new blog?</p>

    <p>I started writing a little blog in the summer of 2017, when I had really hit a local maxima happiness. A year into my software career, feeling medium good about Avuity, feeling very good about May, it seemed right to talk about it, even privately. I'm very glad I wrote all those things down. It makes me quite happy to read <a href="/posts/2017-07-30-marriage/">Marriage</a> and see the seeds of good decisions, even if the execution took a lot of work.</p><p>Why start blogging again now? Because in between writing code every day, I feel like I have <em>thoughts</em> and <em>reactions</em> to things I read and try. I read all of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development/0321146530/">Test-Driven Development</a> in a single day, and like <a href="https://sandimetz.com/99bottles">99 Bottles of OOP</a> before it, I walked away with my brain on fire. I've begun reading <a href="https://www.domainlanguage.com/ddd/">Domain-Driven Design</a>, and I can feel it poking at my brain in the same way. I don't want to lose this feeling, nor do I want to lose the insights these books are providing.</p><p>It's very easy to grind through a tough problem (personally or professionally) and then move onto the next problem without 1) reviewing what I (we, in the context of teams) learned or what challenged me, or 2) putting any effort into practicing or preparing for the future. Mindfulness when learning and practicing goes <em>a long way</em> towards cementing valuable lessons, much in the same way adding and reviewing flash cards might. (I've had my time with Anki, I don't think I need to do that right now.)</p>

    <p>I'm siting here at 1215 after another long day, and I've been thinking to myself, what am I doing? I don't need to spend the money, I don't need to drink wine, I don't need any of this. On the other hand, the wine tastes amazing, the music in my headphones and the music played by the two jazz dudes in the corner are both bangin, I'm written some really good facebook posts today. I don't regret my decisions.</p><p>I had dinner with dad, and he whipped out some classic Jon Bogart-isms. Stuff like, if I actually wanted to do certain things I'd just change the rest of my life to make them happen (wrt travel vs eating out all the time). What's great is, I can let that shit fall away from me easily nowadays. I hear it, I recognize the kind of effect it's had on me at various points in my life, and I let it fall to the wayside. Jonny Dee is a smart man, he's encountered a lot over his life, and I value his wit and wisdom, but like so many pseudo-negative aspects of my life, I have to be willing to say, ‚ÄúNo, I don't need to accept this as my current truth‚Äù the way I did in high school or college or after college.</p><p>I've been feeling really good recently about my place in the world, my goals and my efforts, and the work I've put into my various relationships. I don't know exactly where I'm headed, but like I said a couple posts ago, I'm at a crossroads and I'm trying so hard to navigate this one correctly.</p>

    <p>I don't know what I'm here to write, I just know that I have this feeling like I should keep it up. So here I am, writing more.</p><p>What's the point of writing for one's self? Reflection? I don't get my actual feelings out if I'm not conversing with someone. Julie talks about reading her journals from when she went to therapy early in her relationship with Jon and how much clarity she finds in it, how nice it is to see the clear lines of work and effort and thought that went into various decisions in her life. I don't do that. Maybe I should? I honestly don't find it compelling to write for myself. The kinds of thoughts that I write don't accurately represent me internally in a given moment. Maybe like a sign post signifying the general area it might be helpful to write the various interpretations I've created from parts of my life, and then look back on them later, saying, "Ah from this vantage point, I can see the shape of the land, the whole from all of the pieces I could barely consider when in the tasks and minutia."</p><p>Compare this to when I was in high school and early college, writing on Livejournal. I experienced so many strong emotions I had trouble processing, and writing for that kind of audience helped a bit. So many of those old posts feel like I couldn't handle the changes in my life, external and internal. Not so much like that anymore.</p>
