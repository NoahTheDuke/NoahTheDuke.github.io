    <p>idk why or when this happened but at some point i learned about super stimuli and became deeply unsettled by them and i’m now leery of anything that resemble one. feels too easy to fall off the cliff and lose a sense of what’s “average”.</p><p>maybe i’m just particular susceptible to them. i read some erotica earlier today and it made my chest constrict in such a way that left me shaken and a little emotionally numb after. a fairly pleasant but also worrisome experience. i want to enjoy my life, i want to be present and engaged, i don’t want to be distracted by thoughts of when i can sneak away to get my next hit of erotica lol.</p><p>there are many things that feel very good but they’re mostly quite hard to get. what changes when they’re suddenly abundant?</p>

    <p>My wife and I finished Fast and Furious 6 last night. Overall, I really like the series. The action is fun, the fights aren’t gratuitous, the characters have plot armor but there’s still plenty of tension, and I’ve totally bought into the whole “family” thing. I genuinely like the characters and watch to see them happy in their lives.</p><p>However, the stakes have grown such that the last couple have felt closer to Mission Impossible or a Marvel movie than F&amp;F 1. We’re well past “over the top racing sequences as finale” and I think that’s really sad.</p><p>I’m gonna keep watching them and enjoying them no doubt, just a little sad we’re so far past the (somewhat) grounded stakes of the original trio of movies.</p>

    <p>roughly 20 years ago, i watched a live action web series, a "tv show" but made by nerds and uploaded to the internet in mp4 or quicktime or whatever format we were using back then. i'm searching for it now and <em>cannot</em> find it (cf popular post about how google sucks now).</p><p>the show was about the crackers and hackers and leakers who got early access to music and movies and released them online, while trying to dodge the feds. the format for each episode was a view of someone's desktop screen and their IRC-equivalent chat windows as they typed messages to each other. in the corner of the screen was a live feed camera of them sitting at their computer, like twitch but with the camera angle usually being from somewhere else in the room.</p><p>i remember there being like 8-10 episodes and all but the final one were this way: irc chats between the person we were following for that episode and their compatriots, and a nearly static image of them sitting at their computer, fake typing. and then the final one had some handheld camera stuff, some bad acting, and a finale i don't actually remember watching.</p>

    <p>Rewatched Coraline on our vacation because my 3 year old imprinted on a Coraline doll at the grocery store.</p><p>The movie fuckin bangs. It’s so good, really witty, beautiful and creepy and unlike Nightmare Before Christmas (which I famously dislike). I love every character, I love the “you must collect 3 items” quest line. I love that the story is about parenting and childhood and isn’t just “my grand/parents are mean so we need to resolve that to move on”. I love the little dogs in their angel wings. I love the dreamlike sequences at the end.</p><p>I love it all. 10/10</p>

    <p>I started playing Fallen London. So far my guy is an idiot who hits things hard. I’m not sure if I like it or don’t yet, but the setting gives me Blades in the Dark vibes so I’m sticking with it for at least a little while.</p><p>Anyone got tips for newcomers?</p>

    <p>Just remembered without provocation that roughly 14 years ago I had reconnected with an old friend from Livejournal. She wanted to be penpals so we exchanged addresses and she sent me a long and intimate letter with drawings in the marginalia, detailing her life after moving to San Francisco.</p><p>In the letter she included a story about modeling nude. My girlfriend at the time found and read the letter and was upset about that story. She didn’t explicitly say that I couldn’t write back but she made the whole situation uncomfortable enough that I never did write back. I threw the letter away shortly after.</p><p>I’m sorry I ghosted you, Sarah. Hope you’re doing okay.</p>

    <p>I hate that gamergate someone buried itself into our understanding of games journalism and games criticism. Frequently I find ostensibly left-leaning (or explicitly leftist) groups and communities who will parrot gg talking points about game reviews or criticism without a hint of self-awareness and then react angrily when called out about it.</p><p>It’s lazy and dismissive to say that a two thousand word review, published weeks after the game’s release, is merely clickbait design to get ad views. It’s the basest kind of critique, requires no defense, and allows no discussion. It is its own kind of clickbait, a jingoism for terminally online nerds to feel like they’ve seen through some veil of reality. And it comes directly from the gg playbook, a simple means of derailing conversations and sowing distrust and discord.</p><p>Anyway, I’ve loved the Facebook group “I’m begging you to play another rpg” but seeing the mods delete my comments and reward this shitty behavior has really soured my feelings.</p>

    <p>when it comes to hobby programming, i don't believe in pushing myself to work on stuff i don't feel like working on. i just lean as far into my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgQCLh9lQ1Y">strange desire</a> as i have energy, and go where my curiosity leads.</p><p>for many years this led to heartbreak and contributed to my deep-set sense of failure, as i slowly accrued a graveyard of unfinished projects and codebases where, once i had satisfied some core question, i walked away to do something else.</p><p>but also, i'm now on my third lil project in the last month, each one has been fruitful and compelling and provocative. i don't know if or when i'll finish them, and yet i feel content with them. i've released more than 10 versions of Splint this year, so what am i looking to prove? nothing.</p>
