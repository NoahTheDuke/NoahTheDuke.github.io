    <p>This book is fucking sick and it’s honestly disappointing to see how little of the machinations and politicking of included in the movies. We’ll see how much that changes in D2 but DUNC felt like the barest smatterings of dialogue and context so we could have some beautiful visuals.</p><p>Which is like fine? But it means that all of the characters are flat, cardboard cutouts of their book selves, that’s basically no compelling reason to care what happens to anyone. My wife, who’s never read the books or seen previous adaptions said, “I can’t pick a favorite character because I don’t know any I’d these characters. Even Paul has no personality, no texture. The movie was one long fight that felt like a prologue to the second film.” I couldn’t disagree with that assessment.</p>

    <p>okay, so i just skimmed the rules book again and there's no GM chapter. i glanced through the realms book and there's no GM chapter there either. There's a chapter with 3 example scenarios, but no thoughts or ideas about how to run a game, no "enemies and adversaries", no "how to build a campaign", no "gm principles", no agenda, no vibes, nothing.</p><p>i know it's from a different era (first edition published in 2008), but i'm really surprised that 2e doesn't include anything. even the ampersand game does this! they've got whole books dedicated to it (varying quality, depending on the edition).</p><p>i'll be honest, this has tempered my enthusiasm quite a bit.</p>

    <p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDVDi4avnwk</p><p>in case you didn't know, vanessa carlton (of "a thousand miles" fame) has continued to release music. her fifth album "Love Is An Art" contains "Companion Star", this beautiful brooding meditation on growth and staying grounded. in the bridge, she repeats "who i want to become, and to whom i always will belong" set to a deep organ. it's my favorite part of the song, a distillation of the whole. i find it satisfying and contemplative, like being wrapped in a warm blanket in the dead of winter.</p><p>i played it for my wife back when it came out, describing these feelings to her, and she said that the whole song and specifically the bridge left her feeling anxious and sad. wild how different people can experience music.</p>

    <p>This shit is raw. The Jeramy-Sarah Ann-Laura fight was revealing of how awful those people are, each of them.</p><p>The Clay-A.D. conversation is heartbreaking. I’ve loved Clay the whole show, watching him grow and learn and it hurt to see him say no. So hearing him get choked up and speak about how he regrets saying no and his work to get better hit me hard.</p>

    <p>I read some of the Reigns setting book and i forgot how fun and weird it is, but this shit is laid out like ass. There’s no “brief overview of the world and peoples”, it’s just immediately multi-page chapters about each nation state, very little by way of “here’s where they are in relation to each other geographically” or “here’s a historical overview”.</p><p>Like opening a book titled “United States of America” and it opens with a mapless description of Alabama, then the next chapter is about Wisconsin, followed by New Hampshire. What the hell.</p>

    <p>I hope I never forget laying in bed after a long day, seeing that @jdq had released the theme song for Palisade, putting it on, and feeling swept away overcome completely immersed in the poignancy and delicate tension. I knew then that the season was going to be something special, even after so many bangers, and every single episode has met that high mark.</p>

    <p>I got my copy of Reign 2e and Reign: Realms. I read through the core book, will read Realms tomorrow. Gonna copy my thoughts from pms I sent my friend:</p><p>Okay, i read it. I skipped the details on the advanced combat and the minutiae of the advantages/powers/magic, but read all the core rules and the company stuff.</p><p>It’s the most traditional game I’ve read in a long time. It’s fun! I love the ORE, i don’t like binary dice mechanics, i love love love Greg Stolze’s writing voice, i like that the text spends some time to say “gm, don’t just run players through a plot” and “players, don’t just sit around waiting for plot to fall from heaven”. I like that a whole chapter is a “table of contents” of the various subsystems, explicitly saying “choose only the roles you want to make the kind of game you want, please don’t pick everything”</p>

    <p>There's an abandoned freeware game made by James Silva (Ska Studios, The Dishwasher, Salt and Sanctuary) in 2002 called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/31152/yukis-vacation/">Yuki's Vacation</a>. He made it in Visual Basic 6 after <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/28374/zombie-smashers-x/">Zombie Smasher X</a> as a way of showing how he made games. I was already obsessed with Zombie Smasher X (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEbGqOB2vaU">just look at this gloriousness</a>), so getting access to the source code was a revelation.</p><p>I spent hours playing around with it, editing the bmps, changing the level design, doing really basic programming (I didn't really know what I was doing) back in 2002 and 2003. It was foundational for me seeing programming as something I could do and not just "magic by people smarter than me".</p><p>Every so often, I search for the code online and can't find it (because who the hell would keep freeware visual basic code for 20+ years), but I think I've come across it <a href="https://www.dssz.com/1809675.html">here</a>. The site is in Chinese and even with Google Translate, I can't get the system to allow me to create an account so I can download this. I hope it doesn't cost money to download, but I'm willing to pay $20 if you can help me out here. It's <em>really meaningful</em> to me.</p>

    <p>i buy almost all of my music through bandcamp, but there are a lot of artists (mostly those signed with big name labels) that don't have their music on it. for the other music i want, i have to use qobuz.</p><p>qobuz, for those who don't know, is a streaming service and digital music store that sells FLAC/etc versions of music from big labels. It's quite comprehensive and boasts the best per-track streaming payout for artists ($0.04 per track listened).</p><p>Alongside that, it's significantly more expensive than bandcamp. For example, <a href="https://enforced.bandcamp.com/album/at-the-walls">At the Walls</a> by Enforced is $8 on Bandcamp. <a href="https://www.qobuz.com/us-en/album/kill-grid-enforced/p7d3ctsub6e1b">Kill Grid</a> (released by Century Media) is $15 for mp3, $18 for FLAC. (I know that At the Walls is cheaper on Qobuz, I'm talking about big label releases rn.)</p>
