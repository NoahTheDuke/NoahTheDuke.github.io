    <p>i played this on my windows xp desktop in the early 00s. blocky 3d. there's a bug/insect-like creature or robot that wanders aimlessly through a level and you have to click on parts of the environment to set it up to help the bug progress. you click a block to move it in front of water to keep the bug from being washed away. you click a platform when the bug steps on it to make it raise like an elevator. etc. your goal is to keeps it alive and help it get to the end of the level. i remember it looking like Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight, but much uglier.</p>

    <p>funny thing has been happening with reviews i've seen of Animal Well: people have been missing small but critical parts of the game in their playground because it's deliberately obtuse and designed to be discovered through play. this has soured some folks on it (such as my brother) who spend 2-5 hours at some part of the game just running around not knowing what to do until someone tells them "you missed x" and then they beat the game shortly after and are like "that was a waste of time" turning a 9/10 to a 6/10.</p><p>however, that has repeatedly been my experience of elden ring. i have consistently missed sign posts, quest lines, critical paths because i'm just playing the game and then i'm wandering around like "what do i do now?" it's not exactly unpleasant but it does kill the enthusiasm and fun while it's happening, and then i'm annoyed when i post in my group chat and someone says "you missed x." but none of the reviews for elden ring i saw mentioned this or were like "it's deeply unpleasant to play without a guide or friend who has already played it."</p><p>i'm not gonna say double standard, but it seems people are more lenient about dumb bullshit in a fromsoft game than an indie game.</p>

    <p>I played and beat <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364100/Lacuna__A_SciFi_Noir_Adventure/">Lacuna</a> this week. Incredible little game. I guessed the big revelation during the prologue so that didn't hit so hard, but the rest was a delight. The way the cases and sheets are filled out was at first really hard and then much easier and more fun as the game went on. I thought i'd gotten everything right and then learned that I missed whole branches because i'd some early mistakes. Feels pretty great, especially for such a short and punchy game.</p><p>Excellent music and soundtrack, beautiful pixel art, compelling universe. I was sad to finish the game, I want to spend more time here.</p>

    <p>thankfully, it was due to general capitalism bs (company bought another company and had to make "cuts") and not because they hated my fuckin guts lol</p><p>but now i'm stuck working my least favorite job, "finding a new job". truly an annoying situation. i hope i can find something fast enough that we don't lose too much of our savings, cuz i still really wanna buy a minivan.</p>

    <p>they're like "how dare you! the swastika is cultural! it's the original meaning!" and i'm like "the ethnic cleaning of muslims is cultural?" and then they call me a racist.</p><p>are they technically nazis? no, of course not, but violent fascists focused on racial and religious purity tend to mimic each other.</p>

    <p>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5</p><p>Abstract:</p><blockquote><p>Recently, there has been considerable interest in large language models: machine learning systems which produce human-like text and dialogue. Applications of these systems have been plagued by persistent inaccuracies in their output; these are often called “AI hallucinations”. We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.</p></blockquote>

    <p>i dropped my iphone nearly a week ago, busted the screen just enough that it no longer registers touches. so i swapped the sim into a flip phone and have been living an offline life.</p><p>lemme tell you what, it's a pretty sick life. i'm slowly losing the sense of "i'm bored for 2 seconds, lemme look at my phone" which has been the bane of my adhd-riddled existence for 15 years.</p><p>the flip phone uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS">KaiOS</a> which is based on the firefox os lol, so it has no good apps and runs like shit, but honestly, having more friction means that i can't/won't load it up with a bunch of stuff. all i do is text my wife and make calls to places, which is ideal.</p>

    <p>watched the final season after taking a year off. what a good fuckin show.</p><details><summary>spoilers</summary>
i am so happy bean and mora ended up together. i shed a tear when mora died, I really thought they'd give the show a poignant ending.
<p>i loved every happy ending, tbh. felt perfectly inline with the show for everyone to live happily ever after.</p></details><p>this is the best show matt groening has ever done, by far.</p>

    <p>idk how to write it. i'm not a poet, i was raised by a writer but words don't come easily to me so when i feel these feelings, all i come up with is stuff like "she's so fucking hot" which is true but also shallow.</p><p>it's like...</p><p>every texture of her body is built to electrify me. each line, each curve, each shadow pulls me in. i feel suffocated by her, like she enters the room and my lungs fill with cotton. i want every square inch of her body in my mouth at once. i see her and it makes me lose my train of thought, i can't focus on anything else. i want to be enveloped by her, smothered and wrapped up and ensconced. i try to alight on a solid fantasy but they merge and meld and flow into the next too fast to hold for more than a moment.</p>

    <p>i'm four chapters in and i don't get it. the art is great, really striking and beautiful and grotesque. but the characters don't make any sense and the plots don't make any sense.</p><p>why is everyone's first idea "stab" or "cut into pieces"? the first chapter was very hard to read, basically incomprehensible character motivations. the second was going along fine until the stabbing and then it fell off the rails. the third started off insane with the regrowth but then there's a dude in the closet??? the conversion to tomie is fun, i liked that, but the basement stuff (more cutting into pieces) felt out of nowhere.</p><p>who are these people? why are they doing anything they're doing? i want to be scared, but i'm so confused that i'm actually laughing out loud.</p>
