A year into my software career, feeling medium good about Avuity, feeling very good about May, it seemed right to talk about it, even privately. I'm very glad I wrote all those things down. It makes me quite happy to read Marriage and see the seeds of good decisions, even if the execution took a lot of work.</description><pubDate>Tue, 31 Aug 2021 12:01:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-08-27-archibus-n1-tutorial/</guid><link>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-08-27-archibus-n1-tutorial/</link><title>Archibus and the SELECT N+1 Problem</title><description>This past week, I had the opportunity to contribute to an existing custom report built for a client. It loaded incredibly slowly, so in between working on the contribution I had been tasked with, I also took it upon myself to speed it up. I think it's time to share what I've learned.</description><pubDate>Sun, 27 Aug 2017 12:51:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-08-08-blank/</guid><link>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-08-08-blank/</link><title>Blank</title><description>I'm siting here at 1215 after another long day, and I've been thinking to myself, what am I doing? I don't need to spend the money, I don't need to drink wine, I don't need any of this. On the other hand, the wine tastes amazing, the music in my headphones and the music played by the two jazz dudes in the corner are both bangin, I'm written some really good facebook posts today. I don't regret my decisions.</description><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2017 21:56:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-08-06-pain/</guid><link>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-08-06-pain/</link><title>Pain</title><description>I don't know what I'm here to write, I just know that I have this feeling like I should keep it up. So here I am, writing more.</description><pubDate>Sun, 06 Aug 2017 15:11:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-07-30-marriage/</guid><link>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-07-30-marriage/</link><title>Marriage</title><description>I'm at this weird crossroads in my life right now, where I can push hard to get married and settle down, and I could also dive back into the "dating" life I led in the winter/spring months. After lots of hemming and hawing, I had some excellent conversations with Ally on Friday night and Saturday morning, which has led me to the conclusion that I should get married. I should ask May, in fact, to marry me.</description><pubDate>Sun, 30 Jul 2017 19:09:00 -0400</pubDate></item><item><guid>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-07-29-intro/</guid><link>https://noahtheduke.github.io/posts/2017-07-29-intro/</link><title>Intro</title><description>Starting any project is difficult, and I suspect regular blogging is not an activity I'll have much luck with, seeing as I've classically hated all forms of writing. However, along with the work in self-care and Success Oriented Mindset I've implemented over the last year, I think it's time to attempt to conquer this issue as well.</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jul 2017 17:15:00 -0400</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
