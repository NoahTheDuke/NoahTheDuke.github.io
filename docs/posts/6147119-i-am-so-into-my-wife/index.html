    <p>idk how to write it. i'm not a poet, i was raised by a writer but words don't come easily to me so when i feel these feelings, all i come up with is stuff like "she's so fucking hot" which is true but also shallow.</p><p>it's like...</p><p>every texture of her body is built to electrify me. each line, each curve, each shadow pulls me in. i feel suffocated by her, like she enters the room and my lungs fill with cotton. i want every square inch of her body in my mouth at once. i see her and it makes me lose my train of thought, i can't focus on anything else. i want to be enveloped by her, smothered and wrapped up and ensconced. i try to alight on a solid fantasy but they merge and meld and flow into the next too fast to hold for more than a moment.</p><p>the issue is that i want to have sex with her but actually i want the delicate intimacy and mirrored lust and raw intensity that is typically a byproduct of sex. the single best to express such feelings is through sexual intimacy but my desire is so much greater.</p>
