    <p>There's an abandoned freeware game made by James Silva (Ska Studios, The Dishwasher, Salt and Sanctuary) in 2002 called <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/31152/yukis-vacation/">Yuki's Vacation</a>. He made it in Visual Basic 6 after <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/28374/zombie-smashers-x/">Zombie Smasher X</a> as a way of showing how he made games. I was already obsessed with Zombie Smasher X (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEbGqOB2vaU">just look at this gloriousness</a>), so getting access to the source code was a revelation.</p><p>I spent hours playing around with it, editing the bmps, changing the level design, doing really basic programming (I didn't really know what I was doing) back in 2002 and 2003. It was foundational for me seeing programming as something I could do and not just "magic by people smarter than me".</p><p>Every so often, I search for the code online and can't find it (because who the hell would keep freeware visual basic code for 20+ years), but I think I've come across it <a href="https://www.dssz.com/1809675.html">here</a>.
