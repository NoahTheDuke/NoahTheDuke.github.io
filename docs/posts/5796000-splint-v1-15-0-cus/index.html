<meta name="description" content="I&#39;ve been sitting on this release for a little while now, trying to find the right way to approach to supporting custom rules.The way the rules work currently, when a file with defrule is evaluated, the defrule macro adds the generated rule to a global atom. This simplifies a lot of stuff in the codebase, and makes adding new rules to splint pretty easy: make a new file, require it in the entrypoint for the library. However, users can&#39;t access that entrypoint from the cli, and while I&#39;ve not exactly hidden the code, I don&#39;t think people should have to write their own entrypoint wrappers merely to include their own rules.Inspired by RuboCop YET AGAIN, I&#39;ve added a new option, settable in the config file or by passing the relevant flag at the cli, to call load-file on a given set of files which will presumably call their custom defrule invocations. Because I&#39;m relying on Clojure&#39;s built-in behavior, there is no extra code necessary for me to parse or validate the paths myself; I pass them to load-file in a loop and print any exceptions that are thrown.">

    <p>I've been sitting on this release for a little while now, trying to find the right way to approach to supporting custom rules.</p><p>The way the rules work currently, when a file with <code>defrule</code> is evaluated, the <code>defrule</code> macro adds the generated rule to a global atom. This simplifies a lot of stuff in the codebase, and makes adding new rules to splint pretty easy: make a new file, require it in the entrypoint for the library. However, users can't access that entrypoint from the cli, and while I've not exactly hidden the code, I don't think people should have to write their own entrypoint wrappers merely to include their own rules.</p><p>Inspired by RuboCop YET AGAIN, I've added a new option, settable in the config file or by passing the relevant flag at the cli, to call <code>load-file</code> on a given set of files which will presumably call their custom <code>defrule</code> invocations. Because I'm relying on Clojure's built-in behavior, there is no extra code necessary for me to parse or validate the paths myself; I pass them to <code>load-file</code> in a loop and print any exceptions that are thrown.</p><p>This doesn't particularly scale if you have many such files, but I don't want to support loading a file-seq (every file in a tree, for example), that feels way too risky even for this already risky behavior.</p><p>Here's hoping some people use and like this! It's one of the coolest features I've put in yet.</p><p>I also added two new rules, small idiomatic suggestions that imo are much better. I don't have a fancy blog to discuss them, giving them an air of authority, but that's okay. Until people start contributing to Splint, I'm gonna do whatever I want lmao.</p><p>Can get it <a href="https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/splint/releases/tag/v1.15.0">here</a>.</p><p>Full changelog under the fold:</p><hr /><h2 id="1150---2024-05-01">1.15.0 - 2024-05-01</h2><h3 id="new-rules">New Rules</h3><ul><li><code>style/is-eq-order</code>: Prefer <code>(is (= 200 status))</code> over <code>(is (= status 200))</code> when writing assertions.</li><li><code>style/prefer-for-with-literals</code>: Prefer <code>(for [item coll] {:a 1 :b item})</code> over <code>(map #(hash-map :a 1 :b %) coll)</code>. (See <a href="https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/splint/issues/10">#10</a>.)</li></ul><h3 id="added">Added</h3><ul><li><code>-r</code>/<code>--require</code> cli flag that can be used multiple times and <code>require</code> top-level config option that takes a vector of strings. These are loaded with <code>load-file</code> at run-time to allow for custom rules to be written and used. (See <a href="https://github.com/NoahTheDuke/splint/issues/8">#8</a>.) This is inherently unsafe, so don't run code you don't know!!!!!</li></ul><h3 id="changed">Changed</h3><ul><li>Slight change to the patterns, now a tail-position <code>?*</code> or <code>?+</code> will immediately return the rest of the current input instead of accumulating it one-by-one. (I mentioned this potential optimization in <a href="https://cohost.org/noahtheduke/post/4532528-splint-updates-oops">my last cohost post about splint</a>. I think it really only matters when consuming large inputs. For anything less than idk maybe 8 elements, it doesn't matter.)</li><li>Reformatted every file to use <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/clojurefmt/">Tonsky's Better Clojure formatting</a>.</li><li><code>lint/warn-on-reflection</code> now checks that the file contains a proper <code>ns</code> form before issuing a diagnostic.</li><li>Updated README speed comparison chart.</li></ul>
