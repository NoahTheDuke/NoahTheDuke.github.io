<meta name="description" content="So where are y&#39;all looking for software jobs? How do you find openings? LinkedIn is only so-so, and dice and indeed and monster are worse than they&#39;ve ever been.

I know I made a significant sum at my last job so I&#39;ve been dramatically lowering my expectations, and yet I&#39;m still finding myself rejected for not doing enough &quot;enterprise software&quot; in my career. Every company in Cincinnati is looking for 3-5 years of Java and Spring/Spring Boot lmao. Working in such an environment would kill me, but I&#39;d do it because I need a job more than I need to be comfortable. Lots of &quot;3-5 years C#&quot;.">
