The same way full metal jacket is anti-war but it was used as a recruiting tool because soldiers love it.For example, the song Remain Violent is anti-cop and yet the lyrics and the t-shirt makes them look sick as shit. Put some red and black protestors in there! Don’t repeat their slogans!The constant threat of a shot to the chest
But defending yourself is resisting arrest
City streets that I called my home
Are starting to look like a combat zoneAll that&#39;s what they want for you to say
Is to remain silent
Now you have the right to remain
