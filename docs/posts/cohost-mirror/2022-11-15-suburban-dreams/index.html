I’d love to post it here, I suspect folks would be at least mildly interested, but I’ve accidentally become a normie.I have a wife who raises our kids while I work, and two kids who run my wife and me ragged. I have a nice suburban house and a steady paycheck and all of the modern accouterment. This is an extremely comfortable and peaceful life.I lost my job at the start of 2022 and spent 1.5 months grinding to find a new job, terrified every day that I wouldn’t and we’d lose everything. That kind of situation, that kind of fear restricts what one considers reasonable risk, meaning that I won’t post about my sex life too publicly for fear of offending the wrong person in power who could ruin my shit.">

I’m not trying to be edgy or dramatic or provocative, I just want to be authentic and open about this part of my life because it feels good to experience and it feels good to share and it feels good to have someone mirror those feelings and experiences too.</p><p>Any of y’all deal with this tension? How did you handle it?</p>
