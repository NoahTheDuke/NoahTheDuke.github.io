    <p>roughly 20 years ago, i watched a live action web series, a "tv show" but made by nerds and uploaded to the internet in mp4 or quicktime or whatever format we were using back then. i'm searching for it now and <em>cannot</em> find it (cf popular post about how google sucks now).</p><p>the show was about the crackers and hackers and leakers who got early access to music and movies and released them online, while trying to dodge the feds. the format for each episode was a view of someone's desktop screen and their IRC-equivalent chat windows as they typed messages to each other. in the corner of the screen was a live feed camera of them sitting at their computer, like twitch but with the camera angle usually being from somewhere else in the room.</p><p>i remember there being like 8-10 episodes and all but the final one were this way: irc chats between the person we were following for that episode and their compatriots, and a nearly static image of them sitting at their computer, fake typing. and then the final one had some handheld camera stuff, some bad acting, and a finale i don't actually remember watching.</p><p>anyone remember this?</p>
