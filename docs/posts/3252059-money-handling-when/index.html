<meta name="description" content="Before I got married, I heard lots of advice about how to handle money in marriage, such as ‚Äúhave separate bank accounts‚Äù and ‚Äúonly use one joint bank account‚Äù and ‚Äúas long as bills are covered, you should buy whatever you want‚Äù and ‚Äúevery penny must be accounted for to make sure nothing funny is happening‚Äù.Back when we were Dual Income No Kids, I just sent her my half of the bills (as I had moved in with her and they were all in her name). It was easy and simple. Once we had our first kid and she quit her job, there was a question of how to handle spending money. I switched my direct deposit to give me an allowance (personal bills, etc) and then send the rest to her with the comment that she could spend as much as she wanted, that I both trusted her and thought she deserved to buy whatever she wanted.This seemed fine but after two years, she admitted that she didn‚Äôt feel free to do whatever, that because her money was muddled in with the bills money, it felt bad to spend it on herself (even tho she knew I was okay with it).">

    <p>Before I got married, I heard lots of advice about how to handle money in marriage, such as ‚Äúhave separate bank accounts‚Äù and ‚Äúonly use one joint bank account‚Äù and ‚Äúas long as bills are covered, you should buy whatever you want‚Äù and ‚Äúevery penny must be accounted for to make sure nothing funny is happening‚Äù.</p><p>Back when we were Dual Income No Kids, I just sent her my half of the bills (as I had moved in with her and they were all in her name). It was easy and simple. Once we had our first kid and she quit her job, there was a question of how to handle spending money. I switched my direct deposit to give me an allowance (personal bills, etc) and then send the rest to her with the comment that she could spend as much as she wanted, that I both trusted her and thought she deserved to buy whatever she wanted.</p><p>This seemed fine but after two years, she admitted that she didn‚Äôt feel free to do whatever, that because her money was muddled in with the bills money, it felt bad to spend it on herself (even tho she knew I was okay with it).</p><p>I came up with a solution I haven‚Äôt seen anyone ever describe (tho there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm the first to come up with it): she opened a second private account, and I set up my DD to send both of us the same allowance, and then send whatever is left over to our joint account. Aka, treat my job as a business and us as the two employees.</p><p>This has worked incredibly well. We both ‚Äúearn‚Äù the same amount of money for our jobs (mine as an employed software dev, her as a stay at home mom), we both have privacy for our personal spending, and as long as we don‚Äôt go wild with our family spending (restaurants, shit for the kids), we save money.</p><p>I recommend it to everyone who wants to treat joint money a little more equitably.</p>
