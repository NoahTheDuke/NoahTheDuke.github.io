    <p>a friend asked me recently about my "poly" status with my wife, and i started to write a short thing which turned into a long thing. here it is as i sent it to her, to avoid editing and nitpicking it into not getting posted.</p><hr /><p>here's a bunch of pieces that all kind of commingle here, so it's a bit of a mess, but the short version is something like:</p><ol><li>i am poly and can and do experience familial and romantic love for multiple people at the same time.</li><li>i am a human bound by causality and time, so i can only do one thing at a time at any given time.</li><li>conceptually "love" is infinite and i can care about many people without effort, but relationships require time and energy for them to have any depth.</li><li>given that, if i'm going to have a meaningfully deep relationship, i need to put in greater and greater efforts to both achieve and then maintain it.</li><li>at a certain point, i can love multiple people, but i find myself disappointed when i want to have a shared history with someone (my now-wife May) but my history is split across N people. Shared history is an important aspect of relationships, and personally, i find great joy in being able to say "remember when we did X?"</li><li>likewise, when i was single and ready to mingle in 2017, i had basically infinite time to meet people and to spread myself out. that extra time has shrunk bit by bit since and now i have roughly 1.5 free hours before bed every day. if i want more than that in a given day, i am necessarily depriving both my wife and kids of valuable time with me and forcing my wife to do stuff like "make dinner, entertain the kids, put them to bed" alone.</li></ol><p>when i was younger, i liked playing piano and had dreams of doing it as a professional of some kind. my parents were like, "our friends' kid plays piano at CCM, we should get dinner." so we went over and had dinner and had a nice time! the daughter showed me some stuff on the piano and i was both intimidated and impassioned until the end of the night when my dad asked her how much she practiced.</p><p>and she was like "merely to keep up my skills, i play roughly 6 hours a day. to improve or really practice a given piece, i sometimes play for 8 hours a day.." i heard that and was like "okay, i'm gonna do something else with my life" lmao</p><p>that perspective tho was super important for me, cuz it's how i view my relationship with my wife. any effort i put into a different relationship is time i'm not putting it into her (ayyy lmao)</p>
