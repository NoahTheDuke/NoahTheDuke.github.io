Without comments, I can't parse magic comments, meaning I can't enable or disable rules inline, only globally. That's annoying and not ideal.

<hr /><p><strong>@noahtheduke</strong> posted:</p><p>Quick follow-up because I meant to post that last night and accidentally left it in my drafts.</p><p>I came up with the idea of parsing <code>#_:splint/ignore</code> the way clj-kondo does it: attaching it as metadata to the following form and then check for the metadata when rules checking. I modified my fork of edamame and it works great, but it's a bit more bulky now. Seems to add a very slight increase in parsing time (2-5ms) which is an acceptable increase.</p><p>I posted in #edamame on Clojurian slack about it, and Borkdude (maintainer of edamame and clj-kondo) recommended using <code>str/replace</code> to convert <code>#_:splint/ignore</code> to <code>^:splint/ignore</code>, which would remove the need for a fork while still attaching the metadata. It works, but it's much more error-prone; regex is a wild beast and cannot be contained.</p><p>I think I'm going to stick with my fork for now, but I can change my mind at any time relatively cheaply.</p>
