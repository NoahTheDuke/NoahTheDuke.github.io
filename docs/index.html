    <div class="paragraph"><p>I started writing a little blog in the summer of 2017, when I had really hit a local maxima happiness.
A year into my software career, feeling medium good about Avuity, feeling very good about May, it seemed right to talk about it, even privately.
I’m very glad I wrote all those things down.
It makes me quite happy to read <a href="/posts/2017-07-30-marriage/">Marriage</a> and see the seeds of good decisions, even if the execution took a lot of work.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Why start blogging again now?
Because in between writing code every day, I feel like I have <em>thoughts</em> and <em>reactions</em> to things I read and try.
I read all of <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/test-driven-development/0321146530/">Test-Driven Development</a> in a single day, and like <a href="https://sandimetz.com/99bottles">99 Bottles of OOP</a> before it, I walked away with my brain on fire.
I’ve begun reading <a href="https://www.domainlanguage.com/ddd/">Domain-Driven Design</a>, and I can feel it poking at my brain in the same way.
I don’t want to lose this feeling, nor do I want to lose the insights these books are providing.</p></div>

On the other hand, the wine tastes amazing, the music in my headphones and the music played by the two jazz dudes in the corner are both bangin, I’m written some really good facebook posts today.
I don’t regret my decisions.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>I had dinner with dad, and he whipped out some classic Jon Bogart-isms.
Stuff like, if I actually wanted to do certain things I’d just change the rest of my life to make them happen (wrt travel vs eating out all the time).
What’s great is, I can let that shit fall away from me easily nowadays.
I hear it, I recognize the kind of effect it’s had on me at various points in my life, and I let it fall to the wayside.
Jonny Dee is a smart man, he’s encountered a lot over his life, and I value his wit and wisdom, but like so many pseudo-negative aspects of my life, I have to be willing to say, ``No, I don’t need to accept this as my current truth'' the way I did in high school or college or after college.</p></div>

Julie talks about reading her journals from when she went to therapy early in her relationship with Jon and how much clarity she finds in it, how nice it is to see the clear lines of work and effort and thought that went into various decisions in her life.
I don’t do that.
Maybe I should? I honestly don’t find it compelling to write for myself.
The kinds of thoughts that I write don’t accurately represent me internally in a given moment.
Maybe like a sign post signifying the general area it might be helpful to write the various interpretations I’ve created from parts of my life, and then look back on them later, saying, "Ah from this vantage point, I can see the shape of the land, the whole from all of the pieces I could barely consider when in the tasks and minutia."</p></div>

After lots of hemming and hawing, I had some excellent conversations with Ally on Friday night and Saturday morning, which has led me to the conclusion that I should get married.
I should ask May, in fact, to marry me.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>I "preposed" to May on Saturday night, after we smanged.
Almost said it during, but I had the good sense to wait until we were cuddling afterwards.
Honestly, I’m a fool with timing.
Thankfully, The Kindest Human, May, responded very positively and generously, considering that I had informally asked her to consider marrying me.
We’re having a conversation tomorrow evening (2017-07-31T20:30 ish).
I hope it goes well, and based on the comments we’ve made to each other, I suspect the smanging will eclipse the marriage talk, lol.</p></div>
