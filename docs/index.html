    <p>i wrote <a href="/posts/2024-01-14-trans-jerry">this post</a> last week but i actually came up with the joke back in the fall. i've been mulling it over ever since, and i think i know why it resonates. this might take a moment to write out tho, so my apologies up front.</p><p>i will start at the end.</p><p>after much introspection, i am not trans. i feel great in my body, i like being seen as a man and by all accounts i experience gender euphoria, i like being "papa" to my kids "husband" to my wife and "son" to my parents, i like my birth name.</p>

    <p>a friend asked me recently about my "poly" status with my wife, and i started to write a short thing which turned into a long thing. here it is as i sent it to her, to avoid editing and nitpicking it into not getting posted.</p><p>here's a bunch of pieces that all kind of commingle here, so it's a bit of a mess, but the short version is something like:</p><ol><li>i am poly and can and do experience familial and romantic love for multiple people at the same time.</li><li>i am a human bound by causality and time, so i can only do one thing at a time at any given time.</li><li>conceptually "love" is infinite and i can care about many people without effort, but relationships require time and energy for them to have any depth.</li><li>given that, if i'm going to have a meaningfully deep relationship, i need to put in greater and greater efforts to both achieve and then maintain it.</li><li>at a certain point, i can love multiple people, but i find myself disappointed when i want to have a shared history with someone (my now-wife May) but my history is split across N people. Shared history is an important aspect of relationships, and personally, i find great joy in being able to say "remember when we did X?"</li><li>likewise, when i was single and ready to mingle in 2017, i had basically infinite time to meet people and to spread myself out. that extra time has shrunk bit by bit since and now i have roughly 1.5 free hours before bed every day. if i want more than that in a given day, i am necessarily depriving both my wife and kids of valuable time with me and forcing my wife to do stuff like "make dinner, entertain the kids, put them to bed" alone.</li></ol>

    <p>Before I got married, I heard lots of advice about how to handle money in marriage, such as “have separate bank accounts” and “only use one joint bank account” and “as long as bills are covered, you should buy whatever you want” and “every penny must be accounted for to make sure nothing funny is happening”.</p><p>Back when we were Dual Income No Kids, I just sent her my half of the bills (as I had moved in with her and they were all in her name). It was easy and simple. Once we had our first kid and she quit her job, there was a question of how to handle spending money. I switched my direct deposit to give me an allowance (personal bills, etc) and then send the rest to her with the comment that she could spend as much as she wanted, that I both trusted her and thought she deserved to buy whatever she wanted.</p><p>This seemed fine but after two years, she admitted that she didn’t feel free to do whatever, that because her money was muddled in with the bills money, it felt bad to spend it on herself (even tho she knew I was okay with it).</p>

    <p>owning and running a company is already mired in a complex set of circumstances and power relationships that i don't have a firm grasp on, but i at least see an aspect of "thing i built alongside other people and have pride in and want to see succeed as a reflection of myself".</p><p>and it's like "yes, get the bag, take the money and run" but also, fucking no way dude, have some pride and dignity. “take the money and run” only applies when no one is reliant on you. once you have staff and people relying on you, you can't just sell out without ruining lives.</p><p>my brother responded to the above with:</p>
