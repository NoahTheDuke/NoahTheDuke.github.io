I'm Noah. I am not a good poster, I don't have the generative spark. I've got a wife and two kids and a house in the suburbs, a basement full of crowdfunded board games I never get to play because time is scarce, and more programming books than I can fit on my shelves. I love Clojure and would use it for the rest of my career if I could.

Programming stuff:

* Built [Splint](https://cljdoc.org/d/io.github.noahtheduke/splint), a Clojure linter focused on style and code shape.
* Revived [Lazytest](https://cljdoc.org/d/io.github.noahtheduke/lazytest), a Clojure BDD test framework.
* Lead development of [jinteki.net](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner), an open source and free implementation of the asymmetric card game Netrunner (formerly Android: Netrunner).
* Built [fixture-riveter](https://github.com/Batterii/fixture-riveter), a port of factory_bot to Typescript. I no longer work for the company and no one else has picked it up so consider it abandoned. (I'm still pretty proud of it, truth be told.)
