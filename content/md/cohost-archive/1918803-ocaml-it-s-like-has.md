Ocaml! It’s like Haskell’s cooler friend. :eggbug-devious:

It’s kind of a toss up between the two but I like the sound of Ocaml’s practicality. The type-system enforced purity of Haskell sounds nightmarish as I am a println debugger whenever I don’t have a lisp repl at hand, and I like the look of Ocaml’s syntax. I’ve read some of the source of Flow, Facebook’s javascript type system, and except for `let x = … in`, it parses really nicely.
