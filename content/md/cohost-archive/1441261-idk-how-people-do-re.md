idk how people do remote work. i've been at it for 3 years and these have been the least productive, most frustrating and painful years of my software career.

work on something. get frustrated. open a new browser tab. go to facebook/cohost/lobsters/etc. immediately close the tab because i should be working and it's not helpful to just mindlessly scroll to avoid doing work. look at the code again. feel frustrated. open a new browser tab. go to...

repeat for 3 years.

i hate this shit. it's nice to work next to real people who know stuff that you don't. then my entire universe is "learn the job and be good at it", whereas right now it's "spend 80% of my effort on staying focused because there are so many points of friction."
