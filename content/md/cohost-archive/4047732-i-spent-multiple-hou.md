<div style="white-space: pre-line;">Everyone I know posted their Spotify Wrapped at the beginning of December. I went a different route and calculated my top 25 albums this year by time spent listening, multiplying scrobbled tracks by their length and grouping by album. (Full list below the fold)

| Band | Album | Total Play Count | Total Time Listened |
--- | --- | --- | ---
The Otolith | Folium Limina | 184 | 32:29:53
Enforced | War Remains | 496 | 27:50:22
Bell Witch | Future's Shadow Part 1: The Clandestine Gate | 18 | 24:58:30
Paramore | This Is Why | 412 | 24:27:5
Creeping Death | Boundless Domain | 325 | 21:55:19
Majesties | Vast Reaches Unclaimed | 327 | 21:0:18
Cave In | Heavy Pendulum | 239 | 20:8:45
Jessie Ware | That! Feels Good! | 264 | 17:43:5
Enslaved | Heimdal | 149 | 17:11:33
Mutoid Man | Mutants | 267 | 16:51:46
Grahm Nesbitt | Floppy Knights Original Soundtrack | 469 | 16:41:11
OROMET | OROMET | 68 | 16:21:32
M. M. Keeravani | RRR | 241 | 14:53:52
Taylor Swift | Midnights | 288 | 11:37:8
Machine Girl | Neon White Original Soundtrack | 276 | 11:9:39
Tomb Mold | The Enduring Spirit | 104 | 10:30:7
Husbandry | A Port in a Storm | 119 | 9:50:45
2 Mello | PHD: Portable Headphone Dancefloor | 127 | 9:7:2
Blackbraid | Blackbraid II | 81 | 9:1:22
Dying Fetus | Make Them Beg for Death | 136 | 8:29:22
Kacey Musgraves | Golden Hour | 133 | 7:53:3
Horrendous | Ontological Mysterium | 108 | 7:31:54
Megaton Sword | Blood Hails Steel - Steel Hails Fire | 101 | 7:24:23
Nintendo | Kirby and the Forgotten Land Original Soundtrack | 204 | 7:20:34
Taylor Swift | 1989 (Taylor's Version) | 127 | 7:17:6

I think this is fairly representative of my current tastes! Except for Megaton Sword, I don't remember listening to this album so much. Maybe I listened to it alone for a whole day and just don't remember that? 

This also doesn't include the roughly 950 plays of "After Laughter" by Paramore, because I played it almost entirely for my children who are obsessed. I made the regrettable decision to delete the whole album from last.fm, which now pains me in retrospect, but too bad dumbass!

24 | Kacey Musgraves | Golden Hour | 133 | 7:53:03
25 | Taylor Swift | Red (Taylor's Version) | 145 | 7:44:10

The big changes are that RRR is much higher (and would be higher still, but i've not been doing any cleaning of track titles, so i'm not converting `Naatu Naatu (from "Rrr")` to `Naatu Naatu`), 2 Mello being much higher (as well he should be), and then the inclusion of YOB, Maharaja, Lena Raine, and Taylor Swift's Red TV.

that [maharaja album](https://maharajaohio.bandcamp.com/album/aviarium) fucks. it's only 22 min long, but i've listened to it so many times.

wow i love music
