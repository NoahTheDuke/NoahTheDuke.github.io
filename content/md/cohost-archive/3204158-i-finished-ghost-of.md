got the platinum trophy cuz i was roughly one hour of collecting away from it.

good game, would recommend. i spent way too long on it tho. i tried to resist my base urge to do everything and accidentally did everything, so it took me 55 hours to reach credits.

i chose to honor my uncleâ€™s wishes at the end of the game. it was the sadder choice but it felt right and it nicely wrapped up that story.
