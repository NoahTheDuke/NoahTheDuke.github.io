There's an abandoned freeware game made by James Silva (Ska Studios, The Dishwasher, Salt and Sanctuary) in 2002 called [Yuki's Vacation](https://www.mobygames.com/game/31152/yukis-vacation/). He made it in Visual Basic 6 after [Zombie Smasher X](https://www.mobygames.com/game/28374/zombie-smashers-x/) as a way of showing how he made games. I was already obsessed with Zombie Smasher X ([just look at this gloriousness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEbGqOB2vaU)), so getting access to the source code was a revelation.

I spent hours playing around with it, editing the bmps, changing the level design, doing really basic programming (I didn't really know what I was doing) back in 2002 and 2003. It was foundational for me seeing programming as something I could do and not just "magic by people smarter than me".

Every so often, I search for the code online and can't find it (because who the hell would keep freeware visual basic code for 20+ years), but I think I've come across it [here](https://www.dssz.com/1809675.html). The site is in Chinese and even with Google Translate, I can't get the system to allow me to create an account so I can download this. I hope it doesn't cost money to download, but I'm willing to pay $20 if you can help me out here. It's _really meaningful_ to me.
