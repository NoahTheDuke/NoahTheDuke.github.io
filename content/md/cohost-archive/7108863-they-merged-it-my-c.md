<div style="white-space: pre-line;">i only started learning Ocaml on Wednesday, but i'm already opening PRs to help improve the documentation on the ocaml.org site: https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml.org/pull/2613

contributing to open source just feels good, what can i say?

it is moderately funny and fucked up that until now, there's not one droplet of information about comments on the ocaml website.</div>
