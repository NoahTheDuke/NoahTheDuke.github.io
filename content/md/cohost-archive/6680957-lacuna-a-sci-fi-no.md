I played and beat [Lacuna](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364100/Lacuna__A_SciFi_Noir_Adventure/) this week. Incredible little game. I guessed the big revelation during the prologue so that didn't hit so hard, but the rest was a delight. The way the cases and sheets are filled out was at first really hard and then much easier and more fun as the game went on. I thought i'd gotten everything right and then learned that I missed whole branches because i'd some early mistakes. Feels pretty great, especially for such a short and punchy game.

Excellent music and soundtrack, beautiful pixel art, compelling universe. I was sad to finish the game, I want to spend more time here.
