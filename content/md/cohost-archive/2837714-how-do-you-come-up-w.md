i do _a lot_ of hobby programming. it's my primary hobby. i spend a lot of time writing code for fun, but it's quote unquote boring stuff like tinkering with an alternative test framework or building a linter or fixing a bug in a library i use.

i sometimes think "i want to make a game, i like games, why shouldn't i?" and then i'm just... empty. completely devoid of ideas or thoughts. i know it's probably something of a muscle i must flex, but i haven't flexed it yet and it's hard to start new things.

i'm only thinking of this now because of the unity stuff. feels like there's excitement in the air alongside the dread, people writing tutorials and recommending things, so why not.

how do you do it?
