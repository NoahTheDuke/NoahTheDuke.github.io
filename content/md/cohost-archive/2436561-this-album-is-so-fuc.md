this album is so fucking meaningful to me. i'd fallen for taylor with red, my girlfriend at the time had shown me the light, and then through a tumultuous year 2013-2014 i moved across the country with her and then back alone a year later to live with my mom and then bleacher's strange desire (perfect album) came out two days later. i spent that summer and fall mourning the life i had lost, thinking about the future, doing my best to get back to dating, and going to therapy.

when 1898 released, i was in a better place than i had been over the summer but still on the rise, and it perfectly framed that period. i had plans to move to new york city before things fell apart, so "welcome to new york" was poignant, a beautiful reminder of what could have been. "out of the woods" fit perfectly next to strange desire and steel train's self-titled. "clean" was the perfect closer, smooth and sweet and hopeful.

> and by morning, gone was any trace of you, i think i am finally clean.

a vivid mixture of sadness and growth. i love this album so fucking much.
