since 1.0, i've done a fair amount of work:

* now checks `:spat/lit` metadata in patterns to allow patterns to use the "special" symbols the dsl is looking for as plain data: `'(defn example [^:spat/lit _]` will look for the symbol `_`, not match on anything.
* wrote a bunch of documentation for rules and patterns and how they work and are built.
* cleaned up the rules documentation pages quite a bit: outside links, an `:updated` field to show the most recent version a rule was changed, a nice `<hr>` between each rule to ensure visual clarity.
* moved 20+ rules from `lint` to `style` genres because they're purely style related.
* added `ctx` to `:on-match` function signature, allowing for global config to be passed in.
* added `:chosen-style`, which allows for rules to define different "styles" instead of having multiple conflicting rules for the same scenario.
* added `"markdown"` as an output format. same as `"full"` but will use `###` headers and fenced code blocks to make it look pretty. i'm not sure the use-case here, but kibit has it and it was easy to add.

shit's coming along nicely and i feel good about it. still fast as hell
