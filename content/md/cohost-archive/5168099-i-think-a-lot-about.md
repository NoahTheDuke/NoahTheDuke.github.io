I think a lot about that conversation at the dinner party near the start of Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson where the stuffy academic is like “We have the information superhighway, but what about the information ghettos that lay beneath?” and Randy is like, “you’re so fucking dumb, that’s not how the internet works” and yet 25 years later it’s exactly how the internet works.
