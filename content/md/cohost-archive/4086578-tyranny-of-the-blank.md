i spent multiple days thinking about a way to approach a technical problem, and decided that starting fresh was the right way to go. i gen'd a new project directory, opened the main file, and then sat and puzzled like the grinch for 3 hours until my puzzler was sore and it was time for bed with nearly nothing written.

maybe some of those thoughts will be helpful in the future, but dang it's annoying to make no visible progress.
