I ended up buying:

* The Cathedral and the Bazaar, by (terrible human) Eric S. Raymond
* Neuromancer, by William Gibson
* Zero History, by William Gibson
* Armor, by John Steakley
* Vampire$, by John Steakley

I’ve read Neuromancer and Armor before but don’t own them and wants to reread them.

Last week, I bought a collection of John Le Carré novels (The Spy Who Came in from the Cold, Call for the Dead, A Murder of Quality, The Looking-Glass War, A Small Town in Germany), and the week before I bought The Passenger and Stella Maris by Cormac McCarthy.

I gotta slow down lol
