These were created by the Null Signal Games playtesters, and NBKelly (current playtest jnet-server developer) implemented them all. We plan on keeping this up for longer than a day, as they're only legal in "standard plus" and "casual", but not permanently.

Also be sure to try out the "pick 5" starting hand mode :eggbug-wink:
