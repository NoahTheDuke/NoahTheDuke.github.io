if you are part of any decision making process that forbids trees and/or grass from playgrounds, i hope you fucking [violates facebook community standards]

if you are part of any litigation against owners of playgrounds related to the presence of trees at a playground (a kid got hurt climbing a tree etc), i hope you fucking [violates facebook community standards]

if you think that barren playgrounds, fully exposed to the sun and covered in heat absorbing plastic, are enjoyable for children, i hope you fucking [violates facebook community standards]

having children has changed my opinion on many things but not this. i've hated treeless playgrounds since I was a child and it's only intensified as perfectly good playgrounds have been ruined for the sake of "safety".
