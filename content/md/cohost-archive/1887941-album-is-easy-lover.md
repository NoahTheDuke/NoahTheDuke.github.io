Album is easy: Lover. It came out the year I got married and right after my wife got pregnant, so we were very much in love and feeling hopeful for the future. We listened to it non-stop during a trip to visit my extended family. Brings up a lot of good memories.

It’s also full of bangers and bops, not a single song I dislike.

Song: I posted a couple days ago that The 1 is my favorite tswong, but that’s probably not actually true. She’s released so many good songs, it hurts to try to choose.

To be a coward, top 5 no order: the 1, out of the woods, lover, everything has changed, getaway car

My list hints at something else: I have been following Jack Antonoff since Steel Train released Trampoline (saw them open for Hanson in 2007), and the Taylor Swift songs where he has a writing credits are generally my favorites on her albums. He has a very particular touch and I suck it up as a weasel sucks eggs.
