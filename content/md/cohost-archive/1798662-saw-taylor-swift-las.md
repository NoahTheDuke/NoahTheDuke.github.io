She was great, the show was great. My wife made me a “Lover” themed friendship bracelet with our wedding date (1-11) on it and I wept during the performance of the song.

3 hours of straight music is wild.

I don’t know that I ever want to see a concert so big again. Even with better seats, I prefer when things are more intimate. On the other hand, the intensity of the crowd was overwhelming and singing along and dancing next to my sisters and mom and wife felt great.
