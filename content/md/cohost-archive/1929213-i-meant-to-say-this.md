<div style="white-space: pre-line;">Ocaml! It’s like Haskell’s cooler friend. :eggbug-devious:

It’s kind of a toss up between the two but I like the sound of Ocaml’s practicality. The type-system enforced purity of Haskell sounds nightmarish as I am a println debugger whenever I don’t have a lisp repl at hand, and I like the look of Ocaml’s syntax. I’ve read some of the source of Flow, Facebook’s javascript type system, and except for `let x = … in`, it parses really nicely.</div>

i meant to say this in the post but I am also really interested in [Factor](https://factorcode.org/). It's a concatenative language, stack-based like Forth, but it's got a lot of really cool high-level features like local variables and meta-programming and a _massive_ built-in set of libraries.

I spent a month or two last year trying to learn it, writing really small programs, and I struggled a lot because of the counter-intuitive nature of "reverse lisp" compared to my One True Love (Clojure) and because it's the opposite of pure, it's like "what if there were no side effects but every input was mutated?"

It's really really cool and weird and makes me feel like I am a genius when I get something working, but I can't envision using it as my full-time language lol.
