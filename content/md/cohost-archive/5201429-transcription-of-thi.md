<div style="white-space: pre-line;">i'm not doing a good job and we can't see an occupational therapist until july.

my 4 year old probably has sensory processing disorder and adhd, she's self-confident and precocious but lacking in any real world experiences, and she triggers me nearly every day like i'm living at home with my dad. (that's another story for another day.)</div>

transcription of this morning, after offering other foods:

Me: "well, what do you want for breakfast?"  
Her: "a egg!"  
Me: "hardboiled?"  
Her: "yes".  
Me: \<makes the egg> here you go, little lady."  
Her: "no, Iâ€™m not hungry."  
Me: "remember yesterday when you were upset and didnâ€™t want to play at the playground even tho you asked to go because you were hungry?"  
Her: "yeah"  
Me: "wanna eat the hard boiled egg we made that your asked for?"  
Her: "no, i donâ€™t like hard boiled eggs, itâ€™s going to be gross."  
Me: "sweet girl, you donâ€™t want cereal, hard boiled eggs, yogurt, or any of our leftovers. you havenâ€™t eaten anything. you need food energy if weâ€™re going to play. we canâ€™t go to the play place if you donâ€™t have any food energy."  
Her: "\<crying> Nooooooooooooo i wanna go!"  
Me: "what do you want to eat?"  
Her: "iâ€™m not hungry!!!!!!!!!!!!"  
Me: ðŸ¤¡
