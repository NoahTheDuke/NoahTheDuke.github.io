<div style="white-space: pre-line;">Before I got married, I heard lots of advice about how to handle money in marriage, such as “have separate bank accounts” and “only use one joint bank account” and “as long as bills are covered, you should buy whatever you want” and “every penny must be accounted for to make sure nothing funny is happening”.

Back when we were Dual Income No Kids, I just sent her my half of the bills (as I had moved in with her and they were all in her name). It was easy and simple. Once we had our first kid and she quit her job, there was a question of how to handle spending money. I switched my direct deposit to give me an allowance (personal bills, etc) and then send the rest to her with the comment that she could spend as much as she wanted, that I both trusted her and thought she deserved to buy whatever she wanted.

This seemed fine but after two years, she admitted that she didn’t feel free to do whatever, that because her money was muddled in with the bills money, it felt bad to spend it on herself (even tho she knew I was okay with it).

I came up with a solution I haven’t seen anyone ever describe (tho there’s no way I’m the first to come up with it): she opened a second private account, and I set up my DD to send both of us the same allowance, and then send whatever is left over to our joint account. Aka, treat my job as a business and us as the two employees.

This has worked incredibly well. We both “earn” the same amount of money for our jobs (mine as an employed software dev, her as a stay at home mom), we both have privacy for our personal spending, and as long as we don’t go wild with our family spending (restaurants, shit for the kids), we save money.

I recommend it to everyone who wants to treat joint money a little more equitably.</div>

<div style="white-space: pre-line;">it turns out once you have disparate income levels it actually really helps emotionally to work out some sort of joint finances. if you think about your money as belonging to the family, it's easier to not worry about fairness and instead think about your shared goals

personally, we use ynab and each have separate discretionary money that is for no questions asked spending. we haven't worried about privacy too much but ive told my wife she's welcome to have an unlinked account and fill it from discretionary if she wants

we have separate bank accounts but that's mostly because i think she should have enough of our shared finances (roughly half) in her own name that she never feels trapped in the relationship</div>

I used YNAB for many years but I’m pretty bad at keeping up with it lol. My wife is the same. We can have periods of being on it and then run out of energy for it and then it falls apart. The upkeep is an annoying and necessary part of how it works. We gotta save for a minivan and our next kid, so maybe it’s time to start it up again.

I’m really happy for folks that can do only joint accounts and not feel anything about their partners seeing.

I grew up in a money-tight household, and then went through a long term relationship where money was a large source of tension (I lost my job a lot (4 times in one year at one point lol)), so I need to have money that is both purely mine and unencumbered from expectations to feel at ease. I thought my wife didn’t care as much as me but it turns out she feels similarly.

To paint broadly, the Panopticon informs your behavior even if you’re not being actively observed.
