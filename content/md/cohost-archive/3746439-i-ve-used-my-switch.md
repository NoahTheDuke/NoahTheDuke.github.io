<div style="white-space: pre-line;">I impulsively bought a Steam Deck OLED this week and played it for an hour before bed last night.

The machine is way nicer than the Switch.

The two thumb sticks have perfect positions. Comparatively:

* The PlayStation sticks are too low but relatively easy to reach so it feels like I’m pushing wrong direction to go in a given direction. 
* Xbox sticks are in different positions (derogatory), and the right stick suffers from the same issue as the PlayStation ones.

* The same issues exist for the Switch joycons but significantly worse: if I have to use the right thumb stick for any length of time, my thumb cramps to the point of needing to stop playing entirely. The Pro controller is better due to size and right thumb stick position but isn’t better in any other way.

* The sticks on the Steam Deck are mirrored and at my thumbs natural resting positions so there’s no strain to keep them in place or use them. The right stick is very close to the buttons so moving back and forth feels quick.

My only issue is that games don’t pause when you go to the “desktop”. If you press the home button on the switch or the ps5, the game freezes in place, but as a normal computer, games don’t freeze when using the Steam menu. That’s really annoying lol.

My not real issue with it is that I forgot I haven’t used Steam since 2013 so I need to buy some games to make it worth using lmao. Turns out I have the deluxe version of Guacamelee, the Half Lifes, and the Portals so I don’t have to drop dollars to enjoy it immediately, but I’ve wishlisted a bunch of games that I’m going to pick up when I get more time. (SNAKE FARM, Opportunity: a Sugar Baby story, The Banished Vault, Wildermyth, Pentiment, hi fi rush, etc)</div>

I’ve used my Switch as my go-to indie game device, but I don’t think there’s any reason to keep using it for that now. Unless it’s a switch exclusive, the Steam Deck is better in every way.
