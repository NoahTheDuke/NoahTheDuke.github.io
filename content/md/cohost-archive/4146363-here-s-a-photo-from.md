<div style="white-space: pre-line;">fun fact: our first date, the day i proposed, and the day we got married fall on the same day, jan 11th, each a year apart. makes counting and planning really easy, i highly recommend it.</div>

<div style="white-space: pre-line;">this photo is in the rhinegeist brewery stairwell where we had our first kiss and then a year later where we got married.</div>
