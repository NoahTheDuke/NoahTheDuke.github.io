<div style="white-space: pre-line;">By which I mean: something a creator made that gives them a pass where you'll check out anything they put out simply because their name is attached to it, even if it doesn't seem like it'd be your speed. And maybe it isn't, but you'll give it an honest shot sight unseen.

("Formerly" is okay too, I've got a few that used to be this that I no longer care about)

There are certainly some I'm forgetting, but a couple off the top of my head:

- ***Ghost Trick*** and *Shu Takumi*
- ***Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann*** and *Hiroyuki Imaishi* (and the rest of the Trigger squad)
- ***Pyre*** and *Supergiant Games*

Editing to add a couple:

- ***Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou***, Hitoshi Ashinano
- ***Lucifer and the Biscuit Hammer***, Satoshi Mizukami
- ***Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice***, From Software, look, it is what it is
- ***Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty***, Hideo Kojima, who should maybe be ashamed of *his* words and deeds
- (Formerly) ***Mistborn***, Brandon Sanderson (the period of my life where I cared about the Cosmere whatsoever ended around Stormlight 3)</div>

<div style="white-space: pre-line;">Katalepsis and Necroepilogos

(it gets easier to spell them once you get used to it)

nothing else comes to mind right at the moment, but we may just not be the correct Irenes to come up with stuff</div>
