Rewatched Coraline on our vacation because my 3 year old imprinted on a Coraline doll at the grocery store.

The movie fuckin bangs. It’s so good, really witty, beautiful and creepy and unlike Nightmare Before Christmas (which I famously dislike). I love every character, I love the “you must collect 3 items” quest line. I love that the story is about parenting and childhood and isn’t just “my grand/parents are mean so we need to resolve that to move on”. I love the little dogs in their angel wings. I love the dreamlike sequences at the end.

I love it all. 10/10

All that to say, how THE FUCK did the academy choose Up over it!!! Up fucking sucks! It has a poignant little love story up front and then 90 min of boring dogshit. My least favorite Pixar film.

Might go on a hyperfocusing bender and list every time the Academy chose the wrong animated movie.
