Everyone I know posted their Spotify Wrapped at the beginning of December. I went a different route and calculated my top 25 albums this year by time spent listening, multiplying scrobbled tracks by their length and grouping by album. (Full list below the fold)

I think this is fairly representative of my current tastes! Except for Megaton Sword, I don't remember listening to this album so much. Maybe I listened to it alone for a whole day and just don't remember that?

This also doesn't include the roughly 950 plays of "After Laughter" by Paramore, because I played it almost entirely for my children who are obsessed. I made the regrettable decision to delete the whole album from last.fm, which now pains me in retrospect, but too bad dumbass!
