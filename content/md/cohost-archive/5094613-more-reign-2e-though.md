okay, so i just skimmed the rules book again and there's no GM chapter. i glanced through the realms book and there's no GM chapter there either. There's a chapter with 3 example scenarios, but no thoughts or ideas about how to run a game, no "enemies and adversaries", no "how to build a campaign", no "gm principles", no agenda, no vibes, nothing.

i know it's from a different era (first edition published in 2008), but i'm really surprised that 2e doesn't include anything. even the ampersand game does this! they've got whole books dedicated to it (varying quality, depending on the edition).

i'll be honest, this has tempered my enthusiasm quite a bit.

\<rant> rpgs are not just a bag of loosely connected rules! the rules mean something and cohere into a specific idea or vision for play. and while that vision can be gleaned, teased out through a fine reading of the text, the text and the game as a whole will greatly benefit from the author putting that into the game itself. this is generally put into the gm text, as it's traditionally the gm's responsibility to guide and shape that aspect of the game, but it could be anywhere. sadly, here, it's nowhere to be found.
