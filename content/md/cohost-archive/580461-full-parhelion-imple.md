I have just released Null Signal Games' newest set [Parhelion](https://nullsignal.games/blog/parhelion-is-out-now/) on [jinteki.net](https://www.jinteki.net/). ([Release notes here.](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/releases/tag/112))

My life has been a mess the last year and it pains me that I don't have the time or availability to put 20+ hours of work into jnet anymore, as it desperately needs it, so please accept my humble apologies for the long delay between releases. Congrats to the whole jnet team for their hard work and tireless efforts in implementing 120 new cards in the span of a couple weeks in preparation for this day.
