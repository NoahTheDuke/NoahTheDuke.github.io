[vampire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlPNh_PBZb4)? this song has me _so_ excited for the album. she has leaned into early lorde (complimentary) but with lots of anger. i like this more than everything on SOUR which was fun but felt young and kind of sloppy.

rude as hell to release it this early tho, make us wait until fucking SEPTEMBER COME ON
