idk how to write it. i'm not a poet, i was raised by a writer but words don't come easily to me so when i feel these feelings, all i come up with is stuff like "she's so fucking hot" which is true but also shallow.

it's like...

every texture of her body is built to electrify me. each line, each curve, each shadow pulls me in. i feel suffocated by her, like she enters the room and my lungs fill with cotton. i want every square inch of her body in my mouth at once. i see her and it makes me lose my train of thought, i can't focus on anything else. i want to be enveloped by her, smothered and wrapped up and ensconced. i try to alight on a solid fantasy but they merge and meld and flow into the next too fast to hold for more than a moment.

the issue is that i want to have sex with her but actually i want the delicate intimacy and mirrored lust and raw intensity that is typically a byproduct of sex. the single best to express such feelings is through sexual intimacy but my desire is so much greater.
