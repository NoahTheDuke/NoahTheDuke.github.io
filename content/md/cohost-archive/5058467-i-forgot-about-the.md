<div style="white-space: pre-line;">I read some of the Reigns setting book and i forgot how fun and weird it is, but this shit is laid out like ass. There’s no “brief overview of the world and peoples”, it’s just immediately multi-page chapters about each nation state, very little by way of “here’s where they are in relation to each other geographically” or “here’s a historical overview”.

Like opening a book titled “United States of America” and it opens with a mapless description of Alabama, then the next chapter is about Wisconsin, followed by New Hampshire. What the hell.</div>

i forgot about the [Reign Wiki](http://www.gregstolze.com/REIGNwiki.html). Check out these banger fan-made maps. Why the hell aren't these in the Realms book??????????????? Put this shit in the first chapter with a blurb about each nation state, so we can pick and choose what to read about!!!!!!!!!
