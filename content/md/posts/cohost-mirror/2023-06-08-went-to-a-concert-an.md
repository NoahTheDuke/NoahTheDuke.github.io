![8 yob albums and 1 cave in album](/img/cohost-mirror/1645249-went-to-a-concert-an/topsters2.png)

Saw Cave In open for Yob recently and both were amazing. Bought a sick Yob t-shirt and Cave In long sleeve. Went home and purchased all 8 Yob albums on bandcamp and the latest Cave In album.

Yob got on stage and immediately started playing. After they finished their first song, Michael Scheidt said, "We have 5 more songs. About an hour and a half.". Before playing their last song, he said, "Instead of wasting everyone's time with a fake encore, we prefer to just play really long sets. Here's our last one." and then played an extra long version of Quantum Mystic.

I would highly recommend seeing both bands if you get the chance.
