sometimes i feel like i play a game and i get it, i just don't enjoy it so i put it down (uncharted series). or i get to a point where the game stops being fun for a variety of reasons (elden ring). other times tho, i spend the whole time going "i don't get it, what's the point, where's the fun?"

that's where tears of the kingdom was when i stopped playing it. games like that itch at my brain, cuz i want to get it! i want to be able to say, "okay, i understand what this game is going for, i understand the intended loop of fun, regardless of whether i enjoy it or not, i have some meager understanding of the authorial intent and i think i've experienced enough of that to have a (imo) legit reaction to it"

all that said, i watched a fun and slightly annoying video titled "[Tears of the Kingdom Wants You to Cheat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V73qrqbXeQQ)" and now i feel like i should try the game again.
