So where are y'all looking for software jobs? How do you find openings? LinkedIn is only so-so, and dice and indeed and monster are worse than they've ever been. I'm now 1.5 months into unemployment and it's rough out here.

If we get to September, my wife will have to go back to work (making 1/3 of my previous salary) and then we'll really be in a bind as I have to take time away from job hunting to take care of the kids. I know I made a significant sum at my last job so I've been dramatically lowering my expectations, and yet I'm still finding myself rejected for not doing enough "enterprise software" in my career. Every company in Cincinnati is looking for 3-5 years of Java and Spring/Spring Boot lmao. Working in such an environment would kill me, but I'd do it because I need a job more than I need to be comfortable. Lots of "3-5 years C#".

Bummer I spent 8 years doing Ruby on Rails, Clojure, and Typescript lmao owned fuckin got 'em
