I'm excited as hell for this one. The qualified method syntax along with treating Java methods as first-class values means that writing interop will be much nicer. `:param-tags` letting you differentiate between overloads is killer too. The longer I've spent in Clojure, the more Java I've had to wrangle, and these have been big pain points.
