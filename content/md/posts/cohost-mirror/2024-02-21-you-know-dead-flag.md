you know "dead flag blues" by godspeed you black emperor? there's that line "the sun has fallen down" and i always think ["and the moon has come up, and long ago somebody left with the cup"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F_HoMkkRHv8)

like [granny weatherall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jilting_of_Granny_Weatherall), i'm going to be on my deathbed, surrounded by friends and family, and all i'll be able to think is, "he's going the distance!"
