You know what’s great? Deciding to catch up on a year of a podcast and adding 67 hours of episodes to my existing 10 hours of podcasts in my listening queue.

“What podcast?” I stopped listening to A More Civilized Age when they started Rebels cuz I didn’t have time to watch but wanted to follow along. I’ve watched the whole first season now and I’m ready lol
