i played this on my windows xp desktop in the early 00s. blocky 3d. there's a bug/insect-like creature or robot that wanders aimlessly through a level and you have to click on parts of the environment to set it up to help the bug progress. you click a block to move it in front of water to keep the bug from being washed away. you click a platform when the bug steps on it to make it raise like an elevator. etc. your goal is to keeps it alive and help it get to the end of the level. i remember it looking like Dark Forces 2: Jedi Knight, but much uglier.
