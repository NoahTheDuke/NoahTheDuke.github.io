I’ve started Death’s Door as a palate cleanser after finishing Ghost of Tsushima. I’m an hour in and most of the way through the first dungeon. This game rocks. Feels good to play, the art is pretty and reserved, the music is real nice, and I like this little universe they’ve built. I’m surprisingly intrigued by the main conflict and I can’t wait to see where it goes.
