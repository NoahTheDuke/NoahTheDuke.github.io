1 new rule, 2 new outputs, and one of my favorite changes yet: continue to run after a rule throws an exception.

---

### New rules

- `lint/warn-on-reflection`: Require that `(set! *warn-on-reflection* true)` is called after the `ns` declaration at the start of every file. Defaults to `false`.

### Breaking

- Deprecate `--config`. Add `--print-config`. No timeline for removal of `--config` (maybe never?).

### Added

- `edn` / `edn-pretty` output: Print diagnostics as edn using `clojure.core/prn` and `clojure.pprint/pprint`.
- Continue to process files after running into errors during rules checking.

### Changed

- Dependencies are updated to latest.
- `json` and `json-pretty` keys are now sorted.
- Small performance improvements to patterns.
