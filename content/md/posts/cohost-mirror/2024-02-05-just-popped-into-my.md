just popped into my head the time someone complained to me about their issues with PbtA games being that 2d6+stat makes the bell curve too hard to calculate. i'm trying to remember their argument, but they were annoyed that one of the jumps is like 22% difference, and then the next jump was like 15 or 17% or something. i asked if they didn't play pbta because of it and they were like "no, my group just figured out a better curve with d10s and house rule all pbta games to use it instead." i asked if they knew about the Spire and "sparked by resistence" games, and he was like "we're happy with pbta."

nerds are very silly what they get hung up on.
