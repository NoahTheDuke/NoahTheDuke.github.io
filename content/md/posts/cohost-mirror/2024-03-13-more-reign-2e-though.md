I read some of the Reigns setting book and i forgot how fun and weird it is, but this shit is laid out like ass. There’s no “brief overview of the world and peoples”, it’s just immediately multi-page chapters about each nation state, very little by way of “here’s where they are in relation to each other geographically” or “here’s a historical overview”.

Like opening a book titled “United States of America” and it opens with a mapless description of Alabama, then the next chapter is about Wisconsin, followed by New Hampshire. What the hell.
