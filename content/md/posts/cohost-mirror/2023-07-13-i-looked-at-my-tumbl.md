i looked at my tumblr and most of it is whatever but some of it i'm surfacing stuff that i don't like anymore, that makes me feel weird to read. hard to know what to do with it. i deleted a bunch of posts but is it worth nuking the whole thing? probably. i feel much less of a tie to it than i do my livejournal for example or my facebook, but i did spend a number of years on it actively engaged with parts of a community.
