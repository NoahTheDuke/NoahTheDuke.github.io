built a glass cannon: lots of damage, most everything piercing, overdrive and powerdrive, and use artifacts to get evade and shift. buckshot b was the star of the show with 3 piercing 0s bumped to 1 with powerdrive and then increased to 3 with overpower a. if i could get two jupiter drones on the field, that's an incredible amount of damage in one turn.
