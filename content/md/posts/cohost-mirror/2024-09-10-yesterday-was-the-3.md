felt appropriate for cohost to announce the shutdown on the same day.

a day of mourning and a day of reminiscing and a day of telling stories about what has come and what might come. we cleaned her gravestone, set up some halloween decorations and flowers, ate her favorite candy, and talked about how much she would have loved to see the kids get bigger.

i wish i could have known her longer.

the worst part of vising her grave is walking past the section at the front for children who died. every year it has more plots, and seeing "august 8 2024 - august 8 2024" hit me like a gut punch when we got out of the car.
