Been playing Control on my steam deck. This game fucks. Amazing atmosphere of dread and anxiety without ever getting too scary for me. I’m dumped all of my ability points into telekinesis, because it’s satisfying. Nothing beats it yet except those flying turds.

Idk what’s going on, i barely understand the story, there’s a lot of mystery and very little explanation and I’m just along for the ride, really.
