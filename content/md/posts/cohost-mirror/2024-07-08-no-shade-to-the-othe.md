## top 10
1-3) Hideki Naganuma's songs
4) 2 Mello's I Wann Kno
5\) Klaus Veen's Anime Break
6\) Reso's Chuckin Up
7\) PROUX's Funk Express
8\) Reso's Iridium
9\) Reso's Spectres
10\) Olli's Precious Thing

I think my big issue is that most of the music doesn't have the frenetic upbeat 90s swag that the original JSR and JSRF soundtracks do. There's a fair bit of chill hip hop which is nice, but all of the higher energy music feels more in line with Hotline Miami's vibe.

Just give me like 10 new Hideki Naganuma tracks and then you can put 500 tracks by other folks on the second cd, that's cool, i bet there will be lots of good ones. I just want more of his music.
