Earlier this week I reached a full year of daily knotwords plays. Iâ€™ve missed a fair number in that period, but knotwords generous streak recovery system means that I can actually achieve stuff like this.

This was nearly my game of the year last year and a year later, I have no plans or desire to ever stop playing. Every day is a delight.
