![Still from Vivo of 2d animation sequence. Two characters are dancing together](/img/cohost-mirror/1272146-watched-vivo-again-w/IMG_4440.jpeg)

Watched Vivo again with my family cuz Iâ€™ve been playing the music. Still amazing, has both my wife and I crying at multiple points. Death is sad, turns out, and stories centered in grief and resolution are powerful even when wrapped up in catchy songs and beautiful art.

The cgi isnâ€™t as good as a Pixar film, theyâ€™re best in class, but the commingling of 3d and 2d in the memories/imagination sequences is perfect, and I like the stylized bodies and faces.

And except for Lib-Manuel Mirandaâ€™s rapping, I think this is his best soundtrack. One More Song, My Own Drum, Keep the Beat, Running Out of Time, Inside Your Heart ðŸ˜­, theyâ€™re all so good.

Like Mitchells vs The Machines, I think this movie is vastly underrated because itâ€™s Dreamworks.
