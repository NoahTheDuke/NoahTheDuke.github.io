you know those cooking shows where they travel to some remote countryside place and interview a woman who's been making a certain bread for 50 years and is now old and frail but she's still got it, by god.

and they're like "what's your secret?" and she's like "i've been making this bread every day for fifty years" and they're like "there you have it, folks, the secret is the kind of flour she uses."
