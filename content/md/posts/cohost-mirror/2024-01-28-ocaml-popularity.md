Because I’m terminally online, I had this impression that Ocaml was fairly popular, the younger cousin of Haskell. But it seems to be relatively unknown? Barely any talks on YouTube (the 5+ years of Ocaml workshops aren’t online, which is insane to me), fairly slow traffic on the subreddit and forums, not super active discord server, etc.

I’m still glad to learn it and I’m enjoying it a lot, just surprising to learn.
