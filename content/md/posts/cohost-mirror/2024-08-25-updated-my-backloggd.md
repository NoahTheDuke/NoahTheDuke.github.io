went through steam and howlongtobeat and my playstation 5 and my switch, added nearly everything. i've got a lot of fuckin games, maybe i should play them some time.

anyone have a good way to work through a back log? maybe a randomizer? it seems backloggd doesn't support something natively, and my google searches proved fruitless.
