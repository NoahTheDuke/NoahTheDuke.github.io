So many dead and forgotten blogging platforms in my past. The only one I’ve ever used with any consistency was LiveJournal; I think a lot of that came from it being the _only_ blogging platform available.

I’ve used Facebook as a blogging platform in the past, writing long form thoughts and ideas to my friends. That can feel better in the moment due to the laser precision audience but there’s a low ceiling of quality engagement and the closed platform means I can’t share beyond.

Why a new blog?

Why not!
