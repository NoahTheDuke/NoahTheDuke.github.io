Just remembered without provocation that roughly 14 years ago I had reconnected with an old friend from Livejournal. She wanted to be penpals so we exchanged addresses and she sent me a long and intimate letter with drawings in the marginalia, detailing her life after moving to San Francisco.

In the letter she included a story about modeling nude. My girlfriend at the time found and read the letter and was upset about that story. She didn’t explicitly say that I couldn’t write back but she made the whole situation uncomfortable enough that I never did write back. I threw the letter away shortly after.

I’m sorry I ghosted you, Sarah. Hope you’re doing okay.
