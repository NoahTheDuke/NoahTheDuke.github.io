this isn't really about static vs dynamic typing but that is the current thing, and it's exhausting seeing everyone try their best to dunk on and mock and deride everyone else who disagrees with them. like yes, you think people who use static typing are weak losers, or you think people who use dynamic typing are morons who are too lazy to type a couple extra characters. Good job, everyone! You all suck ass and actively make the art of programming worse for all involved.

fuck you
