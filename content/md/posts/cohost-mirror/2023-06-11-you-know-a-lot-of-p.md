You know, a lot of Pixar protagonists are real jerks. They might grow and change so that they’re somewhat lovable by the end of the movie, but that requires stomaching watching them be mean over and over. It’s an annoying feature of Pixar’s oeuvre.

Some of these movies handle it better than others (Lightening McQueen is a good example of being lovable while being a jerk), but it’s still annoying.

To be specific, I’m thinking of:
* Marlin in Finding Nemo
* Woody in Toy Story 1
* Joy in Inside Out
* Mike Wazowski in Monsters Inc
* Carl Fredricksen in Up
* Lightening McQueen in Cars 1
* Arlo in The Good Dinosaur
