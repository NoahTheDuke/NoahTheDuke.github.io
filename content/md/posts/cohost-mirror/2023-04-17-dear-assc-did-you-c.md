Dear ASSC, did you change the tag sorting algorithm?

Used to be that if i typed in “The”, i got “The Cohost Global Feed” and” The Global Cohost Feed” at the top (because I’ve used those, i thought) followed by random others.
Now it shows only random tags.

If I type in any portion of “The Cohost Global Feed”, it shows me only very long tags containing  that phrase, without showing me the exact phrase.

Did I do something or y’all?
