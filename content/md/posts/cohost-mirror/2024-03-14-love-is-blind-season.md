This shit is raw. The Jeramy-Sarah Ann-Laura fight was revealing of how awful those people are, each of them.

The Clay-A.D. conversation is heartbreaking. Iâ€™ve loved Clay the whole show, watching him grow and learn and it hurt to see him say no. So hearing him get choked up and speak about how he regrets saying no and his work to get better hit me hard.
