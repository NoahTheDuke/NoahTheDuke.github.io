Watched one episode of beef and turned it off. Reminded me of Burn After Reading except these aren’t awful people who I don’t care about, they’re actually decent folks in painful situations in their life. I want both of them to succeed, so there’s no joy to watch them ruin each other’s lives over N episodes. Maybe if this was a movie, I’d suffer through, but 10-12 hours of this is way too much.
