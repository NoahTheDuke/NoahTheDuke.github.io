My wife and I finished Fast and Furious 6 last night. Overall, I really like the series. The action is fun, the fights aren’t gratuitous, the characters have plot armor but there’s still plenty of tension, and I’ve totally bought into the whole “family” thing. I genuinely like the characters and watch to see them happy in their lives.

However, the stakes have grown such that the last couple have felt closer to Mission Impossible or a Marvel movie than F&F 1. We’re well past “over the top racing sequences as finale” and I think that’s really sad.

I’m gonna keep watching them and enjoying them no doubt, just a little sad we’re so far past the (somewhat) grounded stakes of the original trio of movies.
