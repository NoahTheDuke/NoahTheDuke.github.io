Following up on my previous post, I think I’m over “killing” as the primary verb in games. On the one hand I’m really enjoying the flow of Ghost of Tsushima, but on the other I can’t stop thinking “the person I killed was once as cute as my son is now and systemic forces outside their control helped shape them into being violently opposed to me”.

Kind of takes the fun out of it when i can’t think of my enemies as ontologically evil. I blame Death Stranding for showing me that games about human conflict that deemphasize violence can be great.
