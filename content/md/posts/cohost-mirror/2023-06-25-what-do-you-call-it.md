I’ve started to see the power and structural implications in stories, which makes it hard to enjoy certain kinds of stories (for example anything involving royalty). It’s “copaganda” but now for everything, where I feel like I’m recognizing when stories reinforce existing power structures both in real life and in the narrative fiction.

Kind of wish I could stop noticing and just enjoy stories instead of being like “this sad rich kid is the savior of the masses? Sounds fake”
