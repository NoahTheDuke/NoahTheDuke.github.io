Pirating music when the artist/band has a bandcamp: feels very bad, i donâ€™t do this
Pirating music when the artist is only on qobuz: feel less bad but still avoid in general
Pirating music that i have at one time purchased: feels great
Pirating music for bands my mom had heard of: feels great too, means they made it
