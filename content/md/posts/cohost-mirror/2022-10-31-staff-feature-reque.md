@staff feature request: if i see a self reply to a post, can the original be skipped? Itâ€™s one of my least favorite features from tumblr: seeing reply 3 with reply 2 with reply 1 to original post, then scroll down and see reply 2 with reply 1 to original post, then scroll down and see reply 1 to original post, then scroll down and see original post. Like holy shit, yes I get it, please leave me alone.
