On the one hand, I don’t wanna hate on someone’s favorite thing.

On the other hand, I’m watching a truly boring-ass deathcore band rn and while I already don’t like deathcore, these folks are only making me hate them and the whole genre even more.

Giancarlo Esposito face: you think deathcore is not metal. I think classification arguments are dumb as shit and deathcore sucks regardless of what genre it is. We are not the same.
