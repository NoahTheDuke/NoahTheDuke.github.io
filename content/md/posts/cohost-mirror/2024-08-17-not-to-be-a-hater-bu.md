mistborn fuckin sucks, dude. i'm 100 pages in and i'm already over it. the writing is really bad, plodding, obvious. he has a way of writing dialogue that feels like he's got a movie playing in his mind and is trying desperately to transcribe it one to one, but imo that's not how quality fiction works.

everyone's smiling or their existing smiles are deepening, they're stroking their chins, they're asking with surprise, they're nodding and shaking their head or thinning their eyes or pausing or glancing or scowling. it feels like all of the mid fan fiction i've ever read.

not everyone needs to write like cormac mccarthy but come the fuck on
