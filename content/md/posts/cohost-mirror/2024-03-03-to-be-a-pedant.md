I hate that “dad joke” has become a cultural thing, specifically being used to refer to puns. Puns are great, but dad jokes as I understood them are about deliberate misunderstandings for comedic effect. They can use puns to find or create the misunderstanding, but the fun comes from the parallel conversation and the moment of realization.
