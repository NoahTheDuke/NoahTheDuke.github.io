they're like "how dare you! the swastika is cultural! it's the original meaning!" and i'm like "the ethnic cleaning of muslims is cultural?" and then they call me a racist.

are they technically nazis? no, of course not, but violent fascists focused on racial and religious purity tend to mimic each other.
