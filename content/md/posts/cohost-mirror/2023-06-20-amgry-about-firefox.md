idk what it is about linux and firefox dev edition, but this shit sucks ass and is deeply unstable.

---

clicking links will randomly disable the whole tab, showing the spinning loading icon but never resolving, and trying to copy/paste the url will give me "about:newtab" unless i press control-z which magically lets me copy the url.

sometimes i'll middle click a link and the tab will open but it doesn't actually try to load the page, it just opens a fully unusable tab that can't load any webpage and won't give me the url i tried to originally go to.

every third youtube video i open just doesn't play. if i refresh or i load it in a new tab, it might work again, but then again it might not. i frequently just have no access to youtube because the entire website won't load in firefox.

none of these issues exist in chrome, lol. i occasionally double check by opening a given web page in chrome and it pops right up, no issues.

and it's not my network because `ping` and `curl` will grab whatever i'm trying to load no problem. it's _just_ firefox dev being a piece of shit.

i've tried posting to their chatter and their bugzilla but the reactions were "can't replicate", so i gave up on that.
