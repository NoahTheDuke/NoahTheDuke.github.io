![two humans standing at the bottom of a grimy staircase. the woman on the left has green and brown hair, the man on the right has dark hair and a greying beard.](/img/cohost-mirror/4146323-7-years-together-and/image.png)

fun fact: our first date, the day i proposed, and the day we got married fall on the same day, jan 11th, each a year apart. makes counting and planning really easy, i highly recommend it.

this photo is in the rhinegeist brewery stairwell where we had our first kiss and then a year later where we got married.
