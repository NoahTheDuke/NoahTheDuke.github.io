bots suck. they're entirely useless, a less helpful FAQ that doesn't understand anything. I wanted to email y'all and had to spend 5 minutes going through the bot until it had me fill out a "contact us" form in the most annoying way possible. please just give me an email address, i'm begging you, please aaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
