i've never been the biggest fan of fantano, his reviews are mostly just kind of boring, but this is something else. an excoriation of the kanye fanbase, calling them out for their devotion to kanye and their steadfast refusal to meaningfully interact with his increasingly unhinged, misogynist, anti-semetic behavior. i've pulled some quotes (lightly edited for reading clarity) from the review in the "read more" if you don't want to watch it.

> Question: what is the purpose of a music review? I can say at least in terms of my own intent that when I do a music review, I hope to achieve a couple of things: 1) Give the viewer pause and cause them to think about why they do or don't like a piece of music or art, or 2) excite people into giving the music I'm talking about a try. Neither of those goals are possible in any scenario that involves reviewing this album.

> This trajectory Kanye has been on has left him with an interesting mix of fans: 1) hateful psychos who actually agree with the stuff he's been saying, and are in my twitter mentions theorizing that I'm a Jew and that's why I don't like his music. 2) anonymous nihilistic teenagers who don't think anything he says or does has any greater consequence in the world, and are most likely bored and lonely and will defend Kanye because watching him unravel is more entertaining than most things. And 3) cultish weirdos who parasocially obsess over him and everything he does and would follow him to the ends of the Earth. Keep in mind, these individuals have always been in his fanbase, but prior, they were at least mixed in with genuine hip-hop heads.

> Now, these three types of people don't want to hear anything critical about him at all. They openly reject any good faith effort I've made to make them aware of Kanye's downward spiral into Nazi-adjacent rhetoric and imagery in the promotion of this record.

> There are some people who will say, "Anthony, you're being unfair. Separate the art from the artist." But you can't separate this crap from the music, because it's IN THE MUSIC. *[he puts snippets of lyrics over his face]* Look at the lyrics! Read these words! They have meaning, and they are saying things that are not good or normal! You would have to expect me to separate my brain from my skill if you think I'm going to ignore it.

> I think this comment sums it up: "we dont care as long as the music is good, his personality and what he says doesnt matter to me, i only care about the music". How do you penetrate this level of self-imposed ignorance? This person is not listening to Kanye, they're not listening to what I or anyone else has to say about Kanye, and given that this comment was posted _after_ the album was released, they're apparently not listening to the content of the music they supposedly care so much about either, so this argument of, "I only care about the music!" can't possibly be true.
