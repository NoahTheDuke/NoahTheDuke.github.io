i hate when there's some extremely minor inefficiency in a program i'm writing and everything i can think to remove it has some big cost. by minor, i mean 4ns lol. the best alternative i can get is an increase to 15ns. shameful to spend any time on this, but this is the hot path! it could be important!

probably not, but it's fun to dream.
