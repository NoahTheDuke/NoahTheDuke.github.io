i sometimes wonder if programming has made me worse at other tasks.

like i just bought plane tickets to visit my grandma who had a stroke. i intend to visit this weekend but for some reason i bought tickets for april 29th. why didnâ€™t i double check?

part of it is of course my adhd but another part is just writing some code and seeing what happens and adjusting after, a conversational iterative approach to discovering the solution instead of planning the solution and executing on it.

anyway i really fucked myself and now have to spend a bunch of time and probably money switching my flights, provided available flights even exist.
