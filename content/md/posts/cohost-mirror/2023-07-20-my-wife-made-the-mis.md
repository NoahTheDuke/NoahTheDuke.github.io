My wife made the mistake of asking me the dreaded question, the one I have attempted and failed to answer for many people throughout my life: “When I push a button on my keyboard, how does it show up on the screen?”

We spent 2 hours trying to figure out how to make certain concepts understandable for her. Fun quotes:

Me: You know how you can build a physical object that adds two numbers together?
Wife: Really? that’s fucked up, I hate that.

Wife: I just learned that the binary, the ones and the zeros… that’s about electricity. That’s fucked up.
