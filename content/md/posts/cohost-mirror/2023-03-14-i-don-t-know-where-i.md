i don't know where in the software chain the blame lays, but the floating "new chost" box on cohost lags so much that I can type an entire sentence before the characters appear in it. this wouldn't be so bad but the dedicated "new chost" page also uses javascript and is only moderately faster, lagging behind by roughly 1 word instead of entire sentences.
