good news: i'm gonna sign a job offer on monday.

bad news: it's a permanent 1099 (contractor-style) position, so now i gotta fuck with taxes.

good news: it's $80/hr.

bad news: i'll be building evil shit for a defense contractor in java.

i've spent the last two days feeling like shit over the idea of building something used to hurt people, but i've not gotten a second interview in over a month and i gotta feed my kids.

i wish these fuckin tech companies would fix their job requirements and hiring processes so it doesn't take 4-5 interviews over a month only to be rejected or ghosted because they said "software engineer II" but they actually meant "staff engineer".
