i am so happy bean and mora ended up together. i shed a tear when mora died, I really thought they'd give the show a poignant ending.

i loved every happy ending, tbh. felt perfectly inline with the show for everyone to live happily ever after.

this is the best show matt groening has ever done, by far.
