I hope I never forget laying in bed after a long day, seeing that @jdq had released the theme song for Palisade, putting it on, and feeling swept away overcome completely immersed in the poignancy and delicate tension. I knew then that the season was going to be something special, even after so many bangers, and every single episode has met that high mark.
