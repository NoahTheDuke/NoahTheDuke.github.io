It’s weird to use adderall/vyvanse/mixed methamphetamine salts and see immediate results. I’ve been without my drugs for a month due to the shortage but found my stash of old prescription that was too high, and decided to start taking it because I really like being productive.

Turns out, when I take medication, I’m really fucking productive! That’s annoying! Why can’t I just be productive like this normally?

Anyway, I stayed up until nearly 1 am last night working on jnet so at least it wasn’t purely for my job’s benefit.
