a recruiter at a company reached out to me on linkedin, and then i went through 3 rounds of interviews at the company (including a very small coding challenge), and now it's been a week and i've not heard anything from them. i reached out the same day to say how well it went, i emailed two days later to check in, and then hit up the recruiter on linkedin at the end of the week, and crickets.

shit sucks, yo. i don't mind the time spent (i'm jobless, i've got nothing but time), but the lack of decency to let me know what's going on??? it's shameful and disheartening.

if you don't like my work or think i'm not a fit, you can write a single sentence: "Thanks for your time, but we've decided to go with another candidate." you can flower it up all you want, but that's the bare bones what to say! just say that dude, no need to be like this.
