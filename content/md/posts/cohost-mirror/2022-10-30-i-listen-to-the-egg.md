I listen to the [Eggplant podcast](https://eggplant.show/) and think “I could make a game” but then I sit down to program and I have no ideas. The primary thing I enjoy is programming, not game design, even tho I want to enjoy game design.

Same with roguelikes. Every year during Roguelikedev Does the Complete Tutorial, I give it a try even tho I am very bad at roguelikes and have never beat one or even come close.

All of this is to say, I’ve joined the Lisp Game Jam 2022 using Clojure and I’m probably going to make a roguelike because graphics and action are hard lol. We’ll see how it goes!
