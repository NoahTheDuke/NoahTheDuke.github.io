when it comes to hobby programming, i don't believe in pushing myself to work on stuff i don't feel like working on. i just lean as far into my [strange desire](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgQCLh9lQ1Y) as i have energy, and go where my curiosity leads.

for many years this led to heartbreak and contributed to my deep-set sense of failure, as i slowly accrued a graveyard of unfinished projects and codebases where, once i had satisfied some core question, i walked away to do something else.

but also, i'm now on my third lil project in the last month, each one has been fruitful and compelling and provocative. i don't know if or when i'll finish them, and yet i feel content with them. i've released more than 10 versions of Splint this year, so what am i looking to prove? nothing.

just the simple pleasure in creating art for ones self.
