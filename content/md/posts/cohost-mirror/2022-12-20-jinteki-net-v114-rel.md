In [release v114](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/releases/tag/114), Francesco Pellegrini fixed a whole mess of bugs, added `set-mark` command, and added some tests to cover bug reports we couldn't reproduce. I added compiling css and cljs in Github Actions, to catch basic compiler errors.

## Thoughts for the future

In the past, I've asked the community for areas that jnet doesn't cover ([Engine shortcomings](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/issues/6497)) or tracked pie-in-the-sky ideas in the github wiki ([BHAGs](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/wiki/BHAGs)). Both of these are good, but they're hidden away. I want to talk about things I am planning or working on for the future because it feels good and because I think talking about them will help me crystalize what needs to be done.

Every so often I get a bee in my bonnet about one aspect or another and I try to fully finish it before I run out of attention or energy or time, but it can be challenging.

I think my next goal is to write some clj-kondo hooks or maybe write a parser/compiler for ability maps. They're a mess and require paying attention to so many things. It's exhausting. I want to tear all this shit apart but it always takes time.

Okay, enough ranting for now.
