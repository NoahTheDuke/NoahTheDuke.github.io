y'all ever heard of [djot](https://djot.net/)? It's another markdown alternative, "a lightweight markup language" that's designed to be easier to parse (by computers). It's pretty nifty and I like the look of it. Makes me want to write a clojure parser for it.

The inline attributes are specifically very cool. Feels like inline css but for markdown instead of hiding html within your markdown.

Given:
```
An attribute on _emphasized text_{#foo
.bar .baz key="my value"}
```
Generates:
```
<p>An attribute on <em class="bar baz" id="foo" key="my value">emphasized text</em></p>
```
