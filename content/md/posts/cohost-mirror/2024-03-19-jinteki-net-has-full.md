[Full release notes](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/releases/tag/123):
- Prevent format filter dropdown from closing when toggling formats by butzopower
- pass ice events should still trigger even when ice is swapped during the pass by butzopower
- Fix :tag-or-bad-pub cost always resolving to remove tag when tag available by butzopower
- Ensure Rebirth options are only Runner IDs by butzopower
- Ack toasts explicitly and prevent toast cycles by butzopower
- fix threat function causing an infinite loop by francescopellegrini 
- RWR patch by NBKelly
- Allow /undo-click to go back multiple clicks by butzopower
- Allow rejoining password protected games by re-entering password by butzopower

and while it says "RWR patch by nbkelly", this was a joint effort between nbkelly, Francesco Pellegrini, and butzopower. nbkelly has kept the playtest server updated as NSG developed the set, and buztopower and francesco did a lot of QA and engine work and test writing to ensure things are as good as they can be today. they're all champions and i'm very proud of them/glad for them to pick up the torch since I no longer have time to work on jnet.
