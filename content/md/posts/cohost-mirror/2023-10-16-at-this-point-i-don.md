owning and running a company is already mired in a complex set of circumstances and power relationships that i don't have a firm grasp on, but i at least see an aspect of "thing i built alongside other people and have pride in and want to see succeed as a reflection of myself".

and it's like "yes, get the bag, take the money and run" but also, fucking no way dude, have some pride and dignity. “take the money and run” only applies when no one is reliant on you. once you have staff and people relying on you, you can't just sell out without ruining lives.

my brother responded to the above with:
> it's moments like that where the absurdity of how companies are structured comes into view. like you're telling me there's one person who decides the livelihoods of everyone at this company? who has complete and arbitrary control over every decision the company makes with no input from the people who are actually doing the labor? what the fuck is that

what the fuck indeed
