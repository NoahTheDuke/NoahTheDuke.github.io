This book is fucking sick and it’s honestly disappointing to see how little of the machinations and politicking of included in the movies. We’ll see how much that changes in D2 but DUNC felt like the barest smatterings of dialogue and context so we could have some beautiful visuals.

Which is like fine? But it means that all of the characters are flat, cardboard cutouts of their book selves, that’s basically no compelling reason to care what happens to anyone. My wife, who’s never read the books or seen previous adaptions said, “I can’t pick a favorite character because I don’t know any I’d these characters. Even Paul has no personality, no texture. The movie was one long fight that felt like a prologue to the second film.” I couldn’t disagree with that assessment.
