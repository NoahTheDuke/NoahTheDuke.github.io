[Lost In Cult: Immortality](https://www.lostincult.co.uk/immortality)

this is so beautiful, i could weep. i bought the fancy book. was expensive :eggbug-nervous: but i cannot wait to read through it.

as much as i wanted the posters, i couldn't bring myself to get the big box. it's so much more expensive and i don't need the soundtracks or the ticket stubs or the separate scripts.

i think i'm gonna replay this game. it's time to immerse myself again.
