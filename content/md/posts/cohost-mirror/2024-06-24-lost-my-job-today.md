thankfully, it was due to general capitalism bs (company bought another company and had to make "cuts") and not because they hated my fuckin guts lol

but now i'm stuck working my least favorite job, "finding a new job". truly an annoying situation. i hope i can find something fast enough that we don't lose too much of our savings, cuz i still really wanna buy a minivan.
