![taylor swift's twitter account saying "It’s a 2am surprise: The Tortured Poets Department is a secret DOUBLE album. ✌️ I’d written so much tortured poetry in the past 2 years and wanted to share it all with you, so here’s the second installment of TTPD: The Anthology. 15 extra songs. And now the story isn’t mine anymore… it’s all yours. 🤍"](/img/cohost-mirror/5628386-i-fell-asleep-before/image.png)

i fell asleep before it released at midnight, so now i can enjoy all 2 hours as a single unit.
