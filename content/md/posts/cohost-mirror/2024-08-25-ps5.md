why the fuck do i need to download a game that's on the goddamn disc onto my console. just play the game like every other console for the last 40 years. now i gotta juggle installs??? buy an external hard drive??? just play the fucking game bro. "ooooh but it's hard to load things from the disc" just put less shit in the game. make it smaller, use fewer 1 gig textures. it's not hard, in fact it's much easier to do less and make less stuff. i know because i do less every day, i under achieve on purpose and it's quite nice.
