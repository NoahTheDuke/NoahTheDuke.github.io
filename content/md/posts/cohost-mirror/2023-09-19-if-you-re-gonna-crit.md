One of my favorite thrash bands is Warbringer. Their lyrics are generally anti-war but they fall into the trap of accidentally glorifying it . The same way full metal jacket is anti-war but it was used as a recruiting tool because soldiers love it.

For example, the song Remain Violent is anti-cop and yet [the lyrics](https://genius.com/Warbringer-remain-violent-lyrics) and [the t-shirt](https://warbringermusic.com/product/222031) makes them look sick as shit. Put some red and black protestors in there! Don’t repeat their slogans!

> The constant threat of a shot to the chest 
> But defending yourself is resisting arrest 
> City streets that I called my home 
> Are starting to look like a combat zone
>
> All that's what they want for you to say 
> Is to remain silent 
> Now you have the right to remain 
> To remain violent

It’s intended to be anti cop but…
