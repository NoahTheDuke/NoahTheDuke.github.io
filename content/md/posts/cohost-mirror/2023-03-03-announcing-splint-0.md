After lots of work, I have a "good enough" version of [splint](https://cljdoc.org/d/io.github.noahtheduke/splint/), my new Clojure linter, that I can now share it with y'all. It has 73 rules, extremely minimal config and cli, and runs faster than every other linter on the market while being only moderately dumber.

I have lots of big plans for this bad boy but for now, suffice to say that it works and it's fast and it's pretty dang cool to make stuff.
