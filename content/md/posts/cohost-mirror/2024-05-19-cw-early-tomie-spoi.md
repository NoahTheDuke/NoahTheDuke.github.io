i'm four chapters in and i don't get it. the art is great, really striking and beautiful and grotesque. but the characters don't make any sense and the plots don't make any sense.

why is everyone's first idea "stab" or "cut into pieces"? the first chapter was very hard to read, basically incomprehensible character motivations. the second was going along fine until the stabbing and then it fell off the rails. the third started off insane with the regrowth but then there's a dude in the closet??? the conversion to tomie is fun, i liked that, but the basement stuff (more cutting into pieces) felt out of nowhere.

who are these people? why are they doing anything they're doing? i want to be scared, but i'm so confused that i'm actually laughing out loud.
