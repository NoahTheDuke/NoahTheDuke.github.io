My favorite porn artist on here got banned. Idk what for, must have been bad enough to not just remove a post but explode the whole page. I’m not gonna tag them, ask me irl if you want to know, and I’m not looking to shit talk @staff, i trust their judgment.

I’m just sad.

The tagging system and their asks and multiple years of backlog was nice. Looking at their mastodon is hell comparatively.

Ah well! That’s one less thing I have to resist clicking “Open 18+?” in public lmao
