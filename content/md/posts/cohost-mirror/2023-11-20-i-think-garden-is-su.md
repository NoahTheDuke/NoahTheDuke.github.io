**@voidmoth** asked:
> do you have a preferred method for generating/integrating CSS in Clojurescript projects (via Garden, CLJSS, or whatever else) or do you just end up writing CSS normally?

I think Garden is super cool, but I am _not_ a frontend kind of person, so I don't have further strong opinions. For jnet, the original dev used Stylus which we have [continued to use](https://github.com/mtgred/netrunner/tree/master/src/css). I find css in generally pretty hard to read and stylus in particular very hard to read lol (very deep nesting with no brackets???) but it works so it's hard to hate on.
