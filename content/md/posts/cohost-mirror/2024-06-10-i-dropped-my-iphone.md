i dropped my iphone nearly a week ago, busted the screen just enough that it no longer registers touches. so i swapped the sim into a flip phone and have been living an offline life.

lemme tell you what, it's a pretty sick life. i'm slowly losing the sense of "i'm bored for 2 seconds, lemme look at my phone" which has been the bane of my adhd-riddled existence for 15 years.

the flip phone uses [KaiOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KaiOS) which is based on the firefox os lol, so it has no good apps and runs like shit, but honestly, having more friction means that i can't/won't load it up with a bunch of stuff. all i do is text my wife and make calls to places, which is ideal.

the biggest loss is not having on-the-go access to music, audio books, and podcasts, which i use when watching my kids play outside or doing housework. i was in the middle of multiple books and lightly behind on my episodes, so now i'm very behind lol. i also miss doing knotwords every day, which was up to a 553 day streak, and zachtronics solitaire while pooping. and not having a nice camera means i now don't have lots of cute pics of my kids.

but if i can figure out a permanent solution for audio (music, books, podcasts), then i don't think i'll ever go back.

all i gotta do now is move my ~20 MFA tokens from the phone to some other system on my laptop. üòÆ‚Äçüí®
