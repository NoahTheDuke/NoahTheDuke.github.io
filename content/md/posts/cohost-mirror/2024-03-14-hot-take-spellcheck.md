i tried to use the word ["immiserate"](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/immiseration) earlier and firefox's spellchecker yelled at me. this is not a technical or archaic word. and yet it doesn't appear in the "top x words" dictionary that's included by default in firefox.

my iphone knows the word, notion doesn't know the word, google docs knows it, neovim doesn't know it.

why are we reliant on these things to tell us which words are "real"? shit's dumb. there will be people out there who read or hear a word and think "that's a word" and then go to use it in one of these apps, and it will chastise them, saying "that's not a real word". unless they have the temerity to check a real dictionary, they'll just go "i guess i was wrong" and now their chosen speech is worse and the world is less textured than it was before.

man fuck computers, i hate this shit
