Got a new M3 MacBook Pro to replace my Dell Ubuntu machine at my job. The Ubuntu machine was a little janky but rock solid, a powerhouse for the backend webdev work I do. The mbp is a locked down nightmare, covered in corporate malware. I have root, but I’m not allowed to install “non approved software” or “use external storage devices” and they’ll know if I disable anything.

Most importantly, they haven’t granted approval for Karabiner-Elements, so I might lose out on my custom layout I’ve been using for 8 years.

The M3 processor is nice but idk that it’s worth all this shit.

Why do these fuckin jobs have to suck so much ass. Just let me do my job and shut the FUCK UP
