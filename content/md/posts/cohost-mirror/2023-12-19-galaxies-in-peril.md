When looking at my bookshelf in the basement, I found a copy of [Galaxies in Peril](https://samjokopublishing.com/products/galaxies-in-peril-digital-pdf-book) I’d completely forgotten I’d backed on kickstarter. Leafing through it, it looks to be a solid upgrade from Worlds in Peril, which was a mess of a PbtA game lol. (Tho on the other hand, I thought Hack the Planet was supremely bad.)

Anyone play it or run it? What did you think?
