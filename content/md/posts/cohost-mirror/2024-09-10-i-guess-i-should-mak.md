i've got a github pages blog, but that's tied down to github. i can buy a domain name fairly easily, but i gotta point it at something. what i need is a server i guess??? to run my shit. maybe digital ocean, heroku, etc. i asked back in march about self-hosting but didn't follow through because i'm weak.

what's your hosting set up? how do you run yours? have any hot tips for a programmer who doesn't know shit about devops?
