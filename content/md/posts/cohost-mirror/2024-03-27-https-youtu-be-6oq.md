all i could think while watching this was

It's a joint project between Nideo and the Frontier Syndicate. They're inventing the perfect city, a Divine city, the Divine City. The city city. City: The City. What's past a Divine? The City. The City. City City is the next City to be built on Palisade. It's also the next City to be built on Palisade. City City is the future. City City is the Past, capital P. City City comes next. City. City City is The City. I imagine your Curtain folks would see this as The City City, too. A City where City happens. A City where tomorrow is Tuesday, and today? It's Monday City. City is a verb in City City, but City, in City City? City is a noun, too. You're City. I'm City. Welcome to City.
