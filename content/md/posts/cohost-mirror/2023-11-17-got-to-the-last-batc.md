got to the last batch of stages in neon white and these might be the best yet. spoilers below

the book of life cards are sick, amazing mechanic. and then combining that with the various weapons to just go as fast as fucking possible feels insane, like some of the best game feel i've ever experienced from a game.

they've done a wonderful job giving the movement weight and speed while still pausing long enough so you can orient yourself to the new position.

i didn't get the ace on the final fight with neon green because fuck that, i don't have time for a boring ass 5 min level. the first one was pretty fun, very quick. but this is just a slog.
