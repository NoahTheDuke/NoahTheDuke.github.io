Learned about the takeover of da share z0ne yesterday, like a lot of terminally online folks. Pretty disappointing and disheartening.

I had assumed that, like dril, this was the work of one person who had changed over time. Tastes change, writing voice changes, goals change, so it makes sense that the quality would shift. Not every dril tweet is a banger, not every da share zone is either.

But learning that the quality drop comes from a coup by a money grubbing asshole who is only mimicking the better work of the people he stole the account from really fucking sucks. Canâ€™t escape the clutches of greed or money anywhere.
