Started playing Jedi Survivor after burning out on Elden Ring again.

This game is a blast. The grappling hook feels  great, the writing is fun, Cameron Monaghan's voice acting is a little subdued for my tastes but that's okay. new force powers are odd, still getting used to them, but the split blade is sick.

there's freaking battle droids in this one, so we get their chatter!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 10/10 game

I just love star wars so much.
