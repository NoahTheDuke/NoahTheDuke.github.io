in case you didn't know, vanessa carlton (of "a thousand miles" fame) has continued to release music. her fifth album "Love Is An Art" contains "Companion Star", this beautiful brooding meditation on growth and staying grounded. in the bridge, she repeats "who i want to become, and to whom i always will belong" set to a deep organ. it's my favorite part of the song, a distillation of the whole. i find it satisfying and contemplative, like being wrapped in a warm blanket in the dead of winter.

i played it for my wife back when it came out, describing these feelings to her, and she said that the whole song and specifically the bridge left her feeling anxious and sad. wild how different people can experience music.
