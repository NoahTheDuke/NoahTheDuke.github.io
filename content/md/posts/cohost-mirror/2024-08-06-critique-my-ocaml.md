i applied to ahrefs and the first step was this challenge. i suspect a more seasoned ocaml programmer could have done it faster than i, but i've also never done any socket programming, so there were a lot of things to learn all at once.

gimme your feedback! even tho i doubt i'll get the job, i'm interested in continuing to use Ocaml. it's fun to push myself into new things!
