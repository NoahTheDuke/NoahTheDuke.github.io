cohost made it very easy to post. bluesky makes it easy to post but posting there sucks. even tho cohost was public, it gave a wonderful illusion of being out of sight (if not actually private) which enabled more freeing posting. the nicer post editor helped too. it's hard to imagine posting shorter things here but where else should i post them?

blogs feel so weighty compared to microblogging.
