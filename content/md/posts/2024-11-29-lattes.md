 Every so often I decide to get a latte from a coffee shop instead of black coffee (pour over preferably). It is nearly always a mistake. I like the taste of black coffee, especially if it's a good bean like a single origin Ethiopian or Guatemalan. Lattes have a nice flavor on first sip, but they tend to sit heavier and don't go cold as gracefully.
 
 The other issue is that lattes want to be cortados, but it's harder to justify paying $3-$5 for 3 oz of drink compared to $4-$6 for 12 oz of coffee. A bit of milk to lighten espresso is great; a bit of espresso to go with my heated milk sucks actually.
 
 I just gotta stop buying lattes, it's almost always a mistake.
