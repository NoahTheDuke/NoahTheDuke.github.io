Every 2 years I enter a state of frenzy, where I become obsessed with the Olympics. I grew up watching the Olympics in prime time with my mom. The whole family and friends would watch, but my mom cared the most and so I did as well. I took many years off of watching for various reasons, missing 2006-2016, and each year since 2018 I've increased the amount I watch. This year is the most yet, relying on Peacock's streaming service that is equal parts shit and excellent.

Here's all the events I've watched so far (as of 2026-02-13):

* Alpine Skiing - Women's Downhill
* Alpine Skiing - Women's Super-G
* Biathlon - Women's 4x6km Relay
* Cross-Country Skiing - Men's Sprint
* Cross-Country Skiing - Women's 10km Interval Start
